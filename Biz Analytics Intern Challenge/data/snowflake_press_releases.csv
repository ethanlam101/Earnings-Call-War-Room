April 30, 2025, and is subject to change with future stock price movements.
A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP guidance measures is not available on a forward-looking
basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, expenses that may be incurred
in the future. Stock-based compensation-related charges, including employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock
transactions, are impacted by the timing of employee stock transactions, the future fair market value of our common stock, and our
future hiring and retention needs, all of which are difficult to predict and subject to constant change. These factors could be
material to our results computed in accordance with GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial
measures in the financial statement tables for our historical non-GAAP financial results included in this release. Our fiscal year ends
January 31, and numbers are rounded for presentation purposes.

Statement Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We report the following non-GAAP financial measures, which have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures
calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP Product gross profit, Operating income, Net income, Net income attributable to Snowflake Inc., and Net income
per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders—basic and diluted. Non-GAAP product gross profit, operating
income, net income, and net income attributable to Snowflake Inc. are each defined as the respective GAAP measure,
excluding, as applicable, the effect of (i) stock-based compensation-related charges, including employer payroll tax-related
items on employee stock transactions, (ii) amortization of acquired intangibles, (iii) expenses associated with acquisitions and
strategic investments, (iv) amortization of debt issuance costs, (v) restructuring charges, net of associated income and
recoveries, (vi) asset impairment related to office facility exit, net of associated sublease income, if any, (vii) adjustments
attributable to noncontrolling interest, and (viii) the related income tax effect of these adjustments as well as the non-
recurring income tax expense or benefit associated with acquisitions. Non-GAAP product gross margin is calculated as non-
GAAP product gross profit as a percentage of product revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin is calculated as non-GAAP
operating income as a percentage of revenue. Our non-GAAP net income per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common
stockholders—basic is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income attributable to Snowflake Inc. by the weighted-average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Our non-GAAP net income per share attributable to
Snowflake Inc. common stockholders—diluted is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income attributable to Snowflake Inc.
by the non-GAAP weighted-average number of diluted shares outstanding, which includes (a) the effect of all potentially
dilutive common stock equivalents (stock options, restricted stock units, employee stock purchase rights under our 2020
Employee Stock Purchase Plan), (b) the potential dilutive effect of the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes using the
if-converted method, and (c) the antidilutive impact, if any, of the Capped Calls entered into in connection with the Notes. The
Capped Calls are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Notes under
certain circumstances. Under GAAP, the antidilutive impact of the Capped Calls is not reflected in diluted shares outstanding
until exercised. For the historical periods presented, there was no material antidilutive impact of the Capped Calls. The
potential dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stoSckkip u ton imtsa iwn citohn tpenetrformance conditions not yet satisfied is included in the

that the performance conditions will be met. Amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest were not material for all periods
presented. We believe the presentation of operating results that exclude these items that are (i) non-cash items, (ii) non-
recurring items, or (iii) items that have highly variable amounts due to factors beyond our control and are unrelated to our core
operations such that management does not consider them in evaluating the business performance or making operating plans,
provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of our operating results and comparison of
operating results across reporting periods.
Free cash flow. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and
equipment and capitalized internal-use software development costs. Cash outflows for employee payroll tax items related to
the net share settlement of equity awards are included in cash flow for financing activities and, as a result, do not have an
effect on the calculation of free cash flow. Free cash flow margin is calculated as free cash flow as a percentage of revenue.
We believe these measures provide useful supplemental information to investors because they are indicators of the strength
and performance of our core business operations.
Adjusted free cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as free cash flow plus (minus) net cash paid (received) on employer
and employee payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions. Employee payroll tax-related items on employee
stock transactions are generally pass-through transactions that are expected to have a net zero impact on free cash flow over
time, but that may impact free cash flow in any given fiscal quarter due to differences between the time that we receive funds
from our employees and the time we remit those funds to applicable tax authorities. We believe that excluding the effects of
these payroll tax-related items will enhance stockholders' ability to evaluate our free cash flow performance, including on a
quarter-over-quarter basis. Adjusted free cash flow margin is calculated as adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of revenue.
We believe these measures provide useful supplemental information to investors because they are indicators of the strength
and performance of our core business operations.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to
evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute
for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar
measures used by other companies. We encourage investors to carefully consider our results under GAAP, as well as our
supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand our business.
Please see the tables included at the end of this release for the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.
Key Business Metrics
We monitor our key business metrics, including (i) free cash flow and (ii) the other metrics set forth below to help us evaluate our
business and growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational
efficiencies. See the section titled “Statement Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for the definition of free cash flow.
The calculation of our key business metrics may differ from other similarly titled metrics used by other companies, securities
analysts, or investors.
Product Revenue. Product revenue is a key metric for us because we recognize revenue based on platform consumption,
which is inherently variable at our customers’ discretion, and not based on the amount and duration of contract terms.
Product revenue is primarily derived from the consumption of compute, storage, and data transfer resources by customers on
our platform. Customers have the flexibility to consume more than their contracted capacity during the contract term and
may have the ability to roll over unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity at
renewal. Our consumption-based business model distinguishes us from subscription-based software companies that generally
recognize revenue ratably over the contract term and may not permit rollover. Because customers have flexibility in the timing
of their consumption, which can exceed their contracted capacity or extend beyond the original contract term in many cases,
the amount of product revenue recognized in a given period is an important indicator of customer satisfaction and the value
derived from our platform. While customer use of our platform in any period is not necessarily indicative of future use, we
estimate future revenue using predictive models based on customers’ historical usage to plan and determine financial
forecasts. Product revenue excludes our professional services and other revenue.
Net Revenue Retention Rate. To calculate net revenue retention rate, we first specify a measurement period consisting of the
trailing two years from our current period end. NextS, wkipe t od emfianine c aonst eonutr measurement cohort the population of customers

under capacity contracts that used our platform at any point in the first month of the first year of the measurement period.
 REQUEST A MEETING WITH MANAGEMENT
The cohorts used to calculate net revenue retention rate include end-customers under a reseller arrangement. We then
calculate our net revenue retention rate as the quotient obtained by dividing our product revenue from this cohort in the
second year of the measurement period by our product revenue from this cohort in the first year of the measurement period.
Any customer in the cohort that did not use our platform in the second year remains in the calculation and contributes zero
product revenue in the second year. Our net revenue retention rate is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations,
spin-offs, and other market activity, and we present our net revenue retention rate for historical periods reflecting these
adjustments. Since we will continue to attribute the historical product revenue to the consolidated contract, consolidation of
capacity contracts within a customer’s organization typically will not impact our net revenue retention rate unless one of
those customers was not a customer at any point in the first month of the first year of the measurement period.
Customers with Trailing 12-Month Product Revenue Greater than $1 Million. To calculate the number of customers with
trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million, we count the number of customers under capacity arrangements
that contributed more than $1 million in product revenue in the trailing 12 months. For purposes of determining our customer
count, we treat each customer account, including accounts for end-customers under a reseller arrangement, that has at least
one corresponding capacity contract as a unique customer, and a single organization with multiple divisions, segments, or
subsidiaries may be counted as multiple customers. We do not include customers that consume our platform only under on-
demand arrangements for purposes of determining our customer count. Our customer count is subject to adjustments for
acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity, and we present our customer count for historical periods
reflecting these adjustments.
Forbes Global 2000 Customers. Our Forbes Global 2000 customer count is a subset of our customer count based on the
2024 Forbes Global 2000 list. Our Forbes Global 2000 customer count is subject to adjustments for annual updates to the list
by Forbes, as well as acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity with respect to such customers, and we
present our Forbes Global 2000 customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments.
Remaining Performance Obligations. Remaining performance obligations (RPO) represent the amount of contracted future
revenue that has not yet been recognized, including (i) deferred revenue and (ii) non-cancelable contracted amounts that will
be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. RPO excludes performance obligations from on-demand
arrangements and certain time and materials contracts that are billed in arrears. Portions of RPO that are not yet invoiced and
are denominated in foreign currencies are revalued into U.S. dollars each period based on the applicable period-end exchange
rates. RPO is not necessarily indicative of future product revenue growth because it does not account for the timing of
customers’ consumption or their consumption of more than their contracted capacity. Moreover, RPO is influenced by a
number of factors, including the timing and size of renewals, the timing and size of purchases of additional capacity, average
contract terms, seasonality, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the extent to which customers are permitted to
roll over unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity at renewal. Due to these
factors, it is important to review RPO in conjunction with product revenue and other financial metrics disclosed elsewhere
herein.

(1) Restructuring charges, net represent certain costs incurred by us in connection with a restructuring plan for a majority-owned
subsidiary, net of associated income and recoveries.
(2) Asset impairment related to office facility exit primarily relates to our San Mateo office facility, which we ceased using during the
three months ended April 30, 2025. There was no associated sublease income for the historical periods presented.
(3) Stock-based compensation-related charges included employer payroll tax-related expenses on employee stock transactions of
approximately $19.5 million and $21.9 million for the three months ended April 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
(4) For the periods in which we had non-GAAP net income, the non-GAAP weighted-average shares used in computing non-GAAP
net income per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders—diluted included (a) the effect of all potentially dilutive
common stock equivalents (stock options, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase rights under our 2020 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan) and (b) the potential dilutive effect of shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes using the if-converted
method, starting from the issuance date of the Notes. The Capped Calls entered into in connection with the Notes had no material
antidilutive impact for any of the historical periods presented. The potential dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units with
performance conditions not yet satisfied is included in the non-GAAP weighted-average number of diluted shares at forecasted
attainment levels to the extent we believe it is probable that the performance conditions will be met.
(5) The amounts for the three months ended April 30, 2025 and 2024 do not include employee payroll taxes of $132.5 million and
$174.6 million, respectively, related to net share settlement of employee restricted stock units, which were reflected as cash
outflows for financing activities.

Snowflake Unveils New Developer Tools to Supercharge
Enterprise-Grade Agentic AI Development
November 4, 2025
Leading organizations like EVgo and STARS are leveraging Snowflake’s unified, intelligent development environment to reduce
operational overhead, increase interoperability, accelerate developer efficiency, and lower total cost of ownership
Enhanced AI-native and collaboration tools accelerate the development of sophisticated, enterprise-grade agentic AI apps by
allowing developers to write code faster and more reliably
Developers can build securely and collaboratively with enhanced features like Workspaces, Git and VS Code integrations,
increased support for open source tooling, and more
No-Headquarters/BOZEMAN, Mont.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), the AI Data Cloud company, today
announced a suite of new developer tools designed to help organizations rapidly build, test, and deploy cutting-edge, enterprise-
ready AI apps faster and more securely. New enhancements to Snowflake’s developer collaboration environment, seamless open
source integrations, and new data quality capabilities further accelerate productivity and reduce overhead, helping teams drive
measurable business value at scale — all within a single, governed platform.
“The success of enterprise AI hinges on having the most
trustworthy data, and the most productive developers,” said
Christian Kleinerman, EVP of Product, Snowflake. “By
delivering a single, intelligent, and governed environment,
we're not just accelerating code development and execution –
we're giving every developer a shorter, simpler path to build
enterprise-ready AI apps that actually drive value. This is the
new blueprint for enterprise innovation and a demonstration
of how Snowflake is delivering on its promise of limitless
Developers can build securely and collaboratively with enhanced features like
interoperability.""
Workspaces, Git and VS Code integrations, increased support for opSeknip to main content
source tooling, and more 
“Snowflake’s new developReEr QcUaEpSaTb Ai lMitiEEeTsI NhGa vWeIT bH eMeAnNAGEMENT
transformative, empowering us to build data pipelines with the
flexibility and interoperability we need, all while using the tools that best fit our workflow,” said Andre Byfield, Principal Data
Architect, Enlyte. “dbt Projects on Snowflake allowed us to deploy and orchestrate our dbt pipelines directly on the Snowflake
platform rather than having to build out that cloud infrastructure ourselves. This represented real cost and time savings for our lean
data engineering team and delivered real-world value to our stakeholders.""
Build with AI for Accelerated Agentic AI Development
The era of agentic AI is already underway, with 20% of organizations actively deploying agents today and another 54% planning to
deploy within the next 12 months1. However, this exponential growth has only intensified the pressure on data engineering teams
to rapidly manage the vast volumes and types of data that power AI.
Snowflake is addressing these pain points head-on by providing AI-native developer tools designed to help teams move into
production faster, and with more confidence:
Build AI Apps More Efficiently: Developers can now streamline their data workflows with Cortex Code (in private preview), a
refreshed AI assistant within the Snowflake UI that lets users interact with their entire Snowflake environment using natural
language. Cortex Code helps users easily understand their Snowflake usage, optimize complex queries, and fine-tune their
results to maximize cost savings.
Accelerate Secure Development at Scale: With enhancements to Snowflake Cortex AISQL(now generally available),
developers can build scalable AI pipelines within Snowflake Dynamic Tables(now generally available) to create AI-inference
pipelines through a simple declarative SQL query. Leveraging AI Redact(in public preview soon) within Cortex AISQL, users
can scale more confidently with the ability to detect and redact sensitive data from unstructured data, allowing them to ready
their multimodal dataset for AI while maintaining security and privacy.
Snowflake Provides the Mission-Critical, Open Foundation for App Development
Snowflake empowers developers with world-class tooling, coupled with interoperability across a wide-range of third-party products,
so they can build the way they want, with their preferred solution. This choice and flexibility is critical to developer productivity,
allowing them to collaborate across AI app development and supercharge velocity.
With Snowflake’s latest innovations, developers can build using the tools they already know and love, without leaving the secure
and governed Snowflake platform:
Accelerate Development with Seamless Collaboration: Snowflake’s centralized development environment Workspaces(now
generally available) eliminates siloed data work and boosts collaboration, providing a unified editor for creating, organizing,
and managing code across multiple file types. Workspaces is enhanced with direct Git Integration(now generally available),
providing developers with a seamless way to review version control, and VS Code Integration(now generally available),
allowing users to work from their preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and share code with the rest of their
team.
Reduce Overhead with Support for Existing Tools: With dbt Projects on Snowflake(now generally available), enterprises such
as Enlyte, InterWorks, NTT DOCOMO, and STARS can build, test, deploy, and monitor their dbt projects directly within their
Snowflake environment — empowering engineers to focus on delivering insights rather than maintaining various tools and
infrastructure.
Increase Productivity with Fewer Code Changes: Snowflake is helping organizations like VideoAmp further accelerate
developer productivity by running existing Apache Spark™² code on Snowflake’s secure engine with Snowpark Connect for
Apache Spark(now generally available). Snowflake partners including BlueCloud, Infosys, Kipi.ai, a WNS Company, and
Tredence are further supporting enterprises with their use of Spark on Snowflake’s platform through Snowpark Connect for
Apache Spark, recognizing it as the leading platform for developer use cases. With the Snowpark execution engine, teams
have achieved 5.6x faster performance and 41% cost savings over managed Spark environments³.
“As a non-profit that delivers life-saving care every day, every dollar counts. When we rebuilt our data and analytics platform, we
needed right-size tooling that balances capability with simSpkliipc ittoy m aanind c coonstetn,”t said Chris Androsoff, Director of Data, STARS. “The

Snowflake Promotes Data Quality and Code Security to Build with Confidence
In order to deploy agentic AI apps at scale, data teams need to ensure that both the quality and security of the data feeding their
initiatives is best-in-class. To simplify the complex task of monitoring and reporting on data reliability, Snowflake has enhanced its
Data Quality User Experience (UI) (in public preview), allowing developers to assess how accurate and trustworthy the data is, and
automatically generating a summary for increased insights. With upgrades to Code Security (now generally available), teams also
benefit from new security constructs that remove the risk of unsecured access to developer code to eliminate data poisoning or
block unauthorized model tampering.

Snowflake Launches AWS Deployment in South Africa to Drive
Data and AI Closer to Customers
September 1, 2025
CAPE TOWN, South Africa--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), the AI Data Cloud company, today announced its
growing footprint in South Africa with the general availability of Snowflake’s AI Data Cloud on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Africa
(Cape Town) Region, enabling customers to unlock deeper data insights powered by AI to drive business innovation, all while
meeting the highest standards of data residency and sovereignty.
The deployment of Snowflake on AWS Africa (Cape Town) Region comes at an important time for organisations to align with local
data residency regulations. The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA), which, similar to Europe's GDPR, governs the
processing of personal information and places stringent requirements on how data is handled, including its transfer across borders.
Additionally, South Africa’s National Policy on Data and Cloud explicitly sets out requirements for government and public-sector
data to be stored within the country's borders. Snowflake’s deployment on AWS Africa (Cape Town) Region, the latest development
in a long-term partnership with AWS, brings data closer to the customer and helps boost end-users’ trust in their cloud
infrastructure.
“Snowflake’s expansion in South Africa is a pivotal step in our commitment to supporting and empowering local organisations with
faster, cost-efficient, and secure data solutions that enable customers to meet local data regulations, all without compromising on
performance or innovation,” said Luan Reineck, Country Manager, South Africa. “With our partnership and local deployment on
AWS, organisations in South Africa can leverage the power of Snowflake’s AI Data Cloud to do more with their data and AI, all while
retaining control over their data, hosting customer data locally and fostering trust with their end customers.”
Customers in South Africa, such as Carry1st, BluNova, and Mukuru are already using Snowflake’s AI Data Cloud to better access
data to drive business decision-making, and capitalise on AI, all within a secure and governed platform.
“As we scale our operations at Carry1st, and work with our team across 20 different countries, it’s critical that we have the right

With Snowflake’s deployment on AWS Africa (Cape Town) Region, regional customers have further flexibility of choice for
deployment, and are able to choose a geographical region that best suits their operational needs.
As part of its continued investment in the South African market, Snowflake is closely collaborating with its diverse network of
system integration partners to drive the One Million Minds initiative, designed to empower learners globally with training and the
development of cutting-edge AI skills. By leveraging Snowflake’s extensive and diverse group of partners, the scaled growth of
Snowflake’s AI Data Cloud platform will position local system integrators, AWS and Snowflake at the forefront of Africa's digital
transformation, empowering local businesses to unlock the full potential of their data, accelerate growth and compete on a global
scale.
Snowflake will host a launch event on September 3 at The Old Biscuit Mill, Cape Town to celebrate bringing Snowflake’s AI Data
Cloud to the region and providing businesses with unmatched scalability, security and performance. For further information or to

“The role of academia is to expose students to the various kinds of people, tools, and technologies they’ll encounter in the real
world,” said Nate Crawford, Software Engineering & Data Science Faculty, University of St. Thomas. “Through the no-cost
Snowflake for Academia program curriculum, as well as the free Snowflake credits, we’ve been able to deliver a robust course that
provides essential skills to those soon to enter what is a rapidly changing work landscape. Exposure to these technologies at this
stage plants the seed for future leaders and supports the development of the skillsets employers are looking for in candidates.”
Within the next year, Snowflake intends to more than double the total enrollment of educators and academic institutions around

customers
Snowflake Adaptive Compute makes warehouses even easier to use, taking the burden of platform management off
customers1 hands, while delivering faster results at a lower cost
Snowflake introduces enhanced interoperability and new AI-powered security and governance in Snowflake Horizon Catalog,
including the Copilot for Horizon Catalog and AI-led monitoring
SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), the AI Data Cloud company, today announced at its annual user
conference, Snowflake Summit 2025, the next evolution of compute innovations that deliver faster performance, enhanced
usability, and stronger price-performance value — raising the bar for modern data infrastructure. This includes Standard Warehouse
– Generation 2 (Gen2) (now generally available), an enhanced version of Snowflake’s virtual Standard Warehouse with next-
generation hardware and additional enhancements to deliver 2.1x1 faster analytics performance and 1.9x2 faster analytics
performance than Managed Spark. In addition, Snowflake introduced Snowflake Adaptive Compute (now in private preview), a new
compute service that lowers the burden of resource management by maximizing efficiency through automatic resource sizing and
sharing. Warehouses created using Adaptive Compute, known as Adaptive Warehouses, accelerate performance for users without
driving up costs, ultimately redefining data management in the era of AI.
“We’re reimagining what customers can expect from a modern data platform, delivering faster performance, easier scalability, and
greater value for every dollar spent,” said Artin Avanes, Head of Core Data Platform, Snowflake. “Snowflake’s Gen2 more than
doubles the speed of core analytics workloads, helping teams make quicker, data-driven decisions. Coupled with Adaptive
Warehouses, we’re enabling customers with an easier, more efficient approach to platform management where resource decisions
Skip to main content
are automated and right-sized. This isn't just about infrastructure improvements, it’s about preparing your business to innovate 
quickly in the fast-moving AI era.”  REQUEST A MEETING WITH MANAGEMENT
“As one of the world’s premier biopharmaceutical companies,
efficiency and scalability are critical to everything we do as we
race to deliver medical innovations. Snowflake’s easy,
connected, and trusted platform has been instrumental in
streamlining our operations so that we can maximize the value
of our data, and the impact we drive for end users,” said Steve

Snowflake Unveils Next Wave of Compute Innovations For Faster, More
is just the beginning of a larger trend in cloud computing — the
Efficient Warehouses and AI-Driven Data Governance
ability to dynamically adjust resources based on workload
demands, without human intervention.”
Snowflake Gen2 Provides 2.1x Faster Analytics Performance
As data volumes grow and workloads multiply, traditional compute can’t keep up — slowing down queries, creating bottlenecks, and
dragging down productivity. Gen2 warehouses are designed for faster performance on today’s data demands, where organizations
are running more complex, end-to-end analytics across rapidly scaling workloads. Powered by upgraded hardware and enhanced
software, these innovations deliver lightning-fast analytics and industry-leading performance. Thousands of global customers can
now leverage this updated version of Snowflake’s current standard virtual warehouse in order to future-proof organizations for a
fast-moving AI world.
Snowflake Adaptive Compute Powers Business Innovation with Better Efficiency
In today’s AI-powered landscape, organizations must continuously find new ways to accelerate time to value across all of their data
in order to stay ahead. For decades, enterprises have grappled with operational drag at every layer of the stack — from time-
intensive cluster management and disruptive upgrades to manual performance tuning and laborious optimizations.
Adaptive Compute marks a major step towards eliminating the operational complexity that often hinders businesses. By
automatically scaling resources and intelligently routing queries behind the scenes, Adaptive Warehouses simplify warehouse
management for customers — freeing up teams so they can focus on innovation instead of the infrastructure behind it. This ensures
infrastructure becomes so seamless, it's virtually invisible to users. With Adaptive Warehouses powered by this compute service,
teams no longer need to manually manage warehouse sizes, concurrency settings, or multi-cluster configurations. Moreover,
Adaptive Warehouses are designed to incorporate the latest hardware and performance enhancements, while also optimizing
resource sharing within an account, maximizing efficiency for superior price-performance.

Tapping into a $15B market, Snowflake Openflow eliminates
these roadblocks by supporting customers from the moment
data is connected to virtually any source, on-premise or in the cloud. It offers an open, extensible, managed, multi-modal data
integration service, integrating structured and unstructured, batch and streaming data. Snowflake Openflow makes the process of
getting data from where it is created to where it can be used effortless — a key element for ensuring seamless data extraction,
transformation, and load (ETL) for AI. Enterprises like Irwin, a FactSet company, Securonix, and WorkWave can now scale their data
integrations with confidence, laying the groundwork for AI innovation, without sacrificing control, simplicity, or governance.
Snowflake Openflow also embraces open standards, so organizations can bring data integrations into a single, unified platform
without vendor lock-in and with full support for architecture interoperability. Powered by Apache NiFi™1, an Apache Software
Foundation project built to automate the flow of data between systems, Snowflake Openflow enables data engineers to build
custom connectors in minutes and run them seamlessly on Snowflake’s managed platform. With Snowflake Openflow, users can
harness their data across the entire end-to-end data lifecycle, while adapting to evolving data standards and business demands.

sources including Box, Google Ads, Microsoft Dataverse, Microsoft SharePoint, Oracle, Proofpoint, Salesforce Data Cloud,
ServiceNow, Workday, Zendesk, and more, to a wide array of destinations including cloud object stores and messaging platforms,
not just Snowflake.
Snowflake Extends Choice and Flexibility with Expanded Capabilities for Data Engineering
In addition to Snowflake Openflow, Snowflake continues to streamline its data engineering capabilities with additional innovations
that help engineers code and automate pipelines with greater confidence, enhancing their existing skills and workflows:

Snowflake Acquires Crunchy Data to Bring Enterprise Ready
Postgres Offering to the AI Data Cloud
June 2, 2025
Empowering enterprises across industries to build and deploy secure, compliant AI agents and applications with Snowflake
Postgres, powered by Crunchy Data's enterprise-grade PostgreSQL
SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), the AI Data Cloud company, today announced at its annual user
conference, Snowflake Summit 2025, its intent to acquire Crunchy Data, a leading provider of trusted open source Postgres
technology and products. This acquisition will bring Snowflake Postgres, the AI-ready, enterprise-grade and developer-friendly
PostgreSQL database to the AI Data Cloud, enabling developers with the full power of Postgres while providing the
uncompromising governance, security and operational standards essential for building and running mission-critical AI applications.
Organizations across industries increasingly require an
enterprise-grade and secure Postgres solution with full
Postgres compatibility for their production apps. Snowflake
Postgres will bring Crunchy Data’s proven track record of
enterprise readiness within FedRAMP compliant environments
directly into Snowflake’s AI Data Cloud.
PostgreSQL continues to dominate as the most popular
database amongst developers, with 49% of all developers

 REQUEST A MEETING WITH MANAGEMENT
With Snowflake Postgres, customers and partners such as Blue Yonder and LandingAI, who currently leverage PostgreSQL to power
their applications’ operational data, can ship faster, operate more efficiently and gain a competitive advantage in the rapidly
evolving shift towards AI agents.
“Our vision is to deliver the world’s most trusted and comprehensive data and AI platform to our customers. Today’s announcement
of our proposed acquisition of Crunchy Data represents another reason why Snowflake is the ultimate destination for all enterprise
data and AI needs,” said Vivek Raghunathan, SVP of Engineering at Snowflake. “We’re tackling a massive $350 billion market
opportunity and a real need for our customers to bring Postgres to the Snowflake AI Data Cloud.”
“We built Crunchy Data with the vision to become a Postgres solution of choice for leading enterprise organizations. Our deep-
rooted commitment to stringent security and comprehensive compliance has made us the trusted Postgres partner for
organizations across regulated industries, including federal agencies, Fortune 500 financial institutions and high-scale SaaS
companies,” said Paul Laurence, Co-Founder at Crunchy Data. “We’re excited to join forces with Snowflake to provide their
customers who already rely on Postgres the ability to run mission-critical regulated workloads with increased confidence and
security on the Snowflake platform.”
With the closing of this acquisition, Snowflake will make a strong commitment to the Postgres community as well as support
existing Crunchy Data customers, while integrating Crunchy Data’s capabilities into Snowflake Postgres. Snowflake Postgres
represents a further advancement in Snowflake’s journey to support transactional data that began with Unistore, which unifies
transactional and analytical data within a single database in Snowflake. Snowflake Postgres complements Unistore by providing
companies with an enterprise-ready solution for transactional applications that require PostgreSQL compatibility.
Snowflake Postgres will be available soon in private preview.
Comments on the News:
“Snowflake’s platform serves as the foundation for Blue Yonder’s vast amount of supply chain data. Bringing PostgreSQL technology
into the Snowflake ecosystem is an opportunity for our development teams to accelerate and simplify benefits for our customers,”
said Chris Burchett, Senior Vice President, Generative AI, Blue Yonder.
“Access to a PostgreSQL database directly within Snowflake has the potential to be incredibly impactful for our team and our
customers, as it would allow us to securely deploy our Snowflake Native App, LandingLens, into our customers’ account. This
integration is a key building block in making it simpler to build, deploy, and run AI applications directly on the Snowflake platform,”
said Dan Maloney, CEO, LandingAI.
Closing of the acquisition is subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.

Snowflake Intelligence Brings Agentic AI to the Enterprise
November 4, 2025
From Fortune 500 companies like Cisco, to global enterprises like Toyota Motor Europe, and sports teams like USA
Bobsled/Skeleton Team, organizations in every industry are leveraging Snowflake Intelligence to democratize data and AI
throughout their business
Innovations such as Cortex Agents, Cortex Knowledge Extensions, and Snowflake managed MCP Server provide the building
blocks that users need to create powerful, custom AI solutions
More than 1,000 Snowflake customers have already leveraged Snowflake Intelligence to deploy over 12,000 AI agents across
their businesses, and that number continues to grow
No-Headquarters/BOZEMAN, Mont.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), the AI Data Cloud company, today
announced that Snowflake Intelligence is now generally available to Snowflake’s global customer base of more than 12,000
organizations. Snowflake Intelligence is an enterprise intelligence agent that provides every user with the ability to answer complex
questions in natural language and puts insights at every employee’s fingertips. With a single question, Snowflake Intelligence can
facilitate deep research and suggest solutions to previously difficult and time-consuming business problems — allowing users to
move beyond the “what” to the critical “why.” In the past three months alone, more than 1,000 Snowflake customers have already
leveraged Snowflake Intelligence to deploy over 15,000 AI agents across their businesses¹, and that number continues to grow. To
help global enterprises further democratize access to their data, Snowflake also announced new innovations that empower users to
easily deploy agentic AI at scale, so they can actually drive ROI from their investments.
“For more than a decade, Snowflake has served as a cornerstone of global enterprises’ data strategies. Our next evolution is about
bringing AI to this data, allowing every customer to unlock intelligence that is uniquely their own,” said Christian Kleinerman, EVP of
Product, Snowflake. “Snowflake Intelligence makes this possible, democratizing the power of AI so every employee can make
smarter and faster decisions, fundamentally changing how our customers will innovate for years to come.""
Snowflake Intelligence: All Your Knowledge. One Trusted AI.
Skip to main content
Getting answers to critical business questions like, ""How are our sales trending?"" has always been slow and difficult, with data 
scattered across various business systems, spreadsheets, emails, and static dashboards. SnowflaRkEeQ UInESteT lAli MgeEEnTcINeG p WuItTsH a MnA eNnAGdE tMoE NthTis
frustration, reinventing how organizations use, understand, and take action from data. Instead of relying on data teams to write
complex code, any employee can now securely talk to all their company's data in one place. This in turn reduces the guesswork in
decision-making, fostering a new culture of data across the enterprise. The combined power of human expertise and Snowflake
Intelligence is fundamentally transforming how global organizations like Cisco, Fanatics, Toyota Motor Europe, TS Imagine, USA
Bobsled/Skeleton Team, and Wolfspeed get work done across the enterprise.
Snowflake Intelligence unifies all enterprise data sources from structured tables and unstructured documents to data from third-
party apps like Salesforce Data 360 via Zero Copy. Unlike other point solutions on the market, Snowflake Intelligence enables
deeper analysis across multimodal data to serve as a thought partner for understanding nuances and relationships across data. Built
for reliability and scale, it’s enterprise-ready with trust, governance, and security at the forefront, allowing employees to confidently
access and analyze data through natural language while helping ensure that confidential information stays confidential. Powered by
industry-leading AI models from providers like Anthropic, Snowflake Intelligence is transforming complex queries into
conversational insights, ultimately democratizing data and AI access across the enterprise.
New innovations from Snowflake’s AI Research Team make Snowflake Intelligence up to three times faster on text-to-SQL queries,
delivering real-time answers with the same trusted accuracy. To increase the trustworthiness and accuracy of responses, the team
also pioneered a novel evaluation method coined the Agent GPA (Goal, Plan, Action) framework that catches up to 95% of errors
when tested on standard datasets, achieving near-human levels of error detection.
Snowflake Provides Choice and Flexibility to Deploy Customized Data Agents
In order to deliver AI apps and agents at scale, enterprises need the choice and flexibility to build solutions that actually drive value
and impact in their real-world environments. Snowflake’s new AI innovations provide the building blocks to help organizations do
just that:
Build Custom, Multi-Agent Solutions: Cortex Agents(now generally available) enables developers to build data agents that can
plan tasks, use tools, and generate responses from both structured and unstructured data. Additionally, Snowflake’s managed
Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server(now generally available) serves as a secure, standardized bridge to external AI agents
like Anthropic, Cursor, and Salesforce’s Agentforce, eliminating custom integration overhead and simplifying enterprises’
application architecture.
Extend the Knowledge and Interoperability of Agents in Snowflake: Users can leverage Cortex Knowledge Extensions and
Sharing of Semantic Views (now generally available) to enrich AI agents with trusted data from an ecosystem of providers
including FactSet, IPinfo, and MSCI.
What Snowflake Customers Are Saying About Snowflake Intelligence:
“At Snowflake, our data team serves as customer zero for Snowflake Cortex AI. Using Snowflake Intelligence, we built an
internal GTM AI Assistant that gives our sales and marketing teams a single place to instantly access everything from go-to-
market knowledge and customer data to competitive intelligence,” said Anahita Tafivizi, Chief Data and Analytics Officer,
Snowflake. ""The AI assistant is actively being used by more than 6,000 employees across sales and marketing, and answers
more than 12,500 questions per week. By harnessing Snowflake Intelligence internally, we can save employees anywhere
from a few minutes on simple customer profile lookups, to multiple hours when used for complex analytics like creating
custom SQL, ultimately democratizing data and AI-powered insights to accelerate deals and go-to-market decisions.""
""At Cisco, we’re relentlessly focused on advancing AI-driven intelligence to make our processes smarter and more adaptive
every day,” Srini Namineni, SVP and Chief Automation Officer, Cisco. “ With Snowflake Intelligence in our toolbox, we’re
developing internal AI agents that can integrate and analyze large volumes of data, paving the way for greater automation and
faster decision-making across our teams.""
“Snowflake is the engine behind FanGraph, our fan identity graph that links millions of touchpoints across our entire
ecosystem of commerce, collectibles, and gaming,” said Maddy Want, VP of Data, Fanatics. “With Snowflake Intelligence,
we're empowering business users across Fanatics to unlock easy and highly accurate segmentation, accelerate enterprise
cross-sell opportunities, and fuel our advertising business by building addressable audiences from our richest data. It’s
transforming how we turn data into market-leading fan experiences, enabling true data exploration and faster decision-

making across the organization.” 
""Snowflake Intelligence has transformed our development timeline, reducing agent deployRmEQeUnEtS Tf rAo MmE EmTIoNnG tWhIsT Hto M AwNeAeGkEsM.E TNhTis
has fundamentally shifted our team's focus from writing code, to prioritizing what truly drives value: building rich business
context and robust semantic models,"" said Thierry Martin, Head of Data and AI, Toyota Motor Europe. ""The result is a
significant competitive advantage — we're bringing secure, compliant data solutions to market faster, while eliminating data
movement risks.”
“In financial markets, speed is everything. For more than three decades, our technology has been foundational to many of the
world’s most sophisticated financial institutions as they make critical decisions in fast-moving markets,” said Thomas
Bodenski, COO and Chief Data & Analytics Officer, TS Imagine. “With Snowflake Intelligence and Cortex AI, we’ve combined
our deep domain expertise with semantic models and agents that let our users act on insight faster than ever — saving them
substantial time and effort. By democratizing the ability to analyze data with AI, we can empower our users to measure and
assess their performance and that of their market counterparts in minutes rather than days.”
“Grit, resilience, and excellence are the hallmarks of our athletes, and we see those same values in Snowflake’s DNA,” said
Curt Tomasevicz, U.S. Olympic gold medalist (Bobsled) and Director of Sport Performance for USA Bobsled/Skeleton. “We are
thrilled to join forces with Snowflake because they understand that the path to excellence is paved with data intelligence. By
unifying our data and making it easy for everyone to harness its insights through AI with Snowflake Intelligence, we can equip
our trainers, coaches, and athletes with the crucial insights that allow us to unlock a measurable advantage on the ice.”
“Our Snowflake journey began with bursting 200+ SQL reporting silos into a unified, governed data ecosystem. Today, with
Snowflake Intelligence, we're unlocking the full potential of data across every function; from factory floor to corporate
functions,” said Priya Almelkar, Chief Information Officer, Wolfspeed. “We've deployed over a dozen AI agents in production,
and the results are transformative: troubleshooting equipment issues in two minutes instead of two hours, faster access to
information that previously took weeks to analyze, better insights from internal knowledge and quantum leap in productivity
and operational efficiency across the enterprise. This is AI in action, embedded in operations, empowering our people, and
driving excellence at scale. The future isn't just data-driven. It's intelligence-powered.""

Snowflake Research Reveals that 92% of Early Adopters See ROI
From AI Investments
April 15, 2025
Global research report shows that 98% of business and IT leaders surveyed plan to invest more in their AI initiatives in 2025,
but 58% claim that making their data AI-ready remains a challenge
Two-thirds of respondents are quantifying their AI ROI, finding that for every dollar spent, they are seeing $1.41 in returns
through cost savings and increased revenue
No-Headquarters/BOZEMAN, Mont.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), the AI Data Cloud company, in collaboration
with Enterprise Strategy Group, today released the “Radical ROI of Generative AI,” a global research report surveying 1,900
business and IT leaders across nine different countries — all of whom are actively using AI for one or more use cases. Of all
respondents, 92% reported that their AI investments are already paying for themselves, and 98% plan to invest more on AI in 2025.
As AI adoption accelerates across global enterprises, a robust data foundation has emerged as the cornerstone of successful
implementation, yet respondents are still grappling with how to make their data AI-ready.
“I’ve spent almost two decades of my career developing AI,
and we’ve finally reached the tipping point where AI is creating
real, tangible value for enterprises across the globe,” said Baris
Gultekin, Head of AI, Snowflake. “With over 4,000 customers
using Snowflake for AI and ML on a weekly basis, I routinely
see the outsized impact these tools have in driving greater
efficiency and productivity for teams, and democratizing data
insights across entire organizations.”

been very or mostly successful. In fact, two-thirds of respondents are already starting to quantify their generative AI ROI today,
finding that for every dollar spent, they are seeing $1.41 in returns (or 41% ROI) through cost savings and increased revenue.
However, there are global nuances around where organizations are focusing their AI efforts that directly correlate to each country's
AI maturity, and their results in terms of driving ROI across regions:
Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) respondents have seen a 44% return on their AI investments. Compared to the global
average, organizations in ANZ were more likely to cite enhancing customer satisfaction as a key goal for their AI initiatives
(53% versus 43%), and less likely to prioritize internal-facing projects (47% versus 55%).
Canada respondents have seen a 43% return on their AI investments. Canadian organizations were more likely to say that
they’re only pursuing initial AI use cases (45% versus 36%), suggesting that many are earlier in their AI adoption journeys than
global counterparts.
France respondents have seen a 31% return on their AI investments. Compared to the global average, French companies are
less likely to train or augment large language models (LLMs) with proprietary data using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
(59% versus 71%), suggesting a lag in maturity for their AI strategies.
Germany respondents have seen a 34% return on their AI investments. German organizations were more likely to report
challenges with infrastructure, particularly in meeting storage and compute requirements for AI (69% versus 54%).
Japan respondents have seen a 30% return on their AI investments. Japanese organizations differed in their strategic goals for
AI, being least likely to focus their AI efforts on customer service and support (30% versus 43%) and financial performance
(18% versus 30%), but the most likely to harness AI to help cut costs (43% versus 32%).
South Korearespondents have seen a 41% return on their AI investments. South Korean businesses are employing mature AI
use cases, reporting the highest use of open source models (79% versus 65%), and are more likely to train or augment models
with RAG (82% versus 71%).
United Kingdom respondents have seen a 42% return on their AI investments. In terms of strategic goals, UK-based
organizations were more likely to prioritize the value AI brings to end users, with respondents beating the global average in
citing both operational efficiency (57% versus 51%) and innovation (46% versus 40%) as primary business drivers.
United States respondents have seen a 43% return on their AI investments. American companies led in successful AI
operationalization, with respondents more often than any other country to say that they’ve been “very successful” at
operationalizing AI to achieve their business goals (52% versus 40%).
Organizations Face Increased Pressure to Select the Right Use Cases
Despite almost all respondents reporting success with their AI initiatives to-date, many organizations are grappling with difficult
decisions to build on the momentum. Amid a sea of opportunities to implement AI within their businesses, respondents reported
challenges with identifying the most impactful use cases and increased pressure to make the right decisions — all while grappling
with limited resources:
Too many use cases, too few resources: 71% of early adopters agree they have more potential use cases that they want to
pursue than they can possibly fund.
Decision-making blind spots: 54% agree that selecting the right use cases based on objective measures like cost, business
impact, and the organization’s ability to execute is hard.
Competitive pressure mounts: 71% acknowledge that selecting the wrong use cases will hurt their company’s market position.
Job security concerns arise: 59% of respondents say that advocating for the wrong use cases could cost them their job.
Overcoming Data Barriers to Maximize AI Effectiveness
Organizations are increasingly incorporating their proprietary data to maximize AI’s effectiveness, with 80% of respondents
choosing to fine-tune models with their own data. Despite this widespread recognition of data's importance — with 71% of
respondents acknowledging that effective model training and fine-tuning requires multi-terabytes of data — significant challenges
persist in making this data AI-ready. With the majority struggling to make use of their most valuable asset, organizations claim that
the following are the biggest data hurdles for driving AI success:

pipelines with familiar SQL syntax — unlocking industry-leading performance
and up to 60% cost savings when filtering or joining data
“In capital markets, speed and precision are everything. For
years, SQL has been the gold standard for transforming data —
and now, with Cortex AISQL, we’re extending that power to unstructured text,” said Thomas Bodenski, Chief Operating Officer, TS
Imagine. “With AISQL, our teams can analyze documents, extract insights, and build intelligence directly in the language they
already know — all without complex engineering workflows. It’s a game-changer for how fast we can respond to markets and deliver
value to clients, while leveraging the Snowflake architecture for high performing SQL processing.""
Snowflake Provides Generative AI-Powered SQL Functions to Help Analysts Do More, Faster
Snowflake helps customers leverage generative AI through familiar SQL queries, redefining how organizations analyze data.
Snowflake Cortex AI has already enabled customers to build and deploy advanced AI models, apps, and agents within the security
perimeter of the AI Data Cloud. Now, Cortex AISQL marks the next leap forward by leveraging generative AI to create powerful
new query capabilities, effectively turning every data analyst into an AI engineer. Cortex AISQL is powered by leading models from
Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, OpenAI, and others, coupled with core functionality and performance optimizations already built directly
into Snowflake’s SQL engine. With Cortex AISQL performance optimizations (now in private preview), enterprises now gain
performance improvements ranging from 30-70% depending on datasets, with up to 60% cost savings when filtering or joining data
across thousands of records, empowering them to scale their analytics capabilities for strategic decision-making.
Traditionally, SQL has been limited to structured and semi-structured data, leaving analysts dependent on developers to access
insights from unstructured sources. Cortex AISQL changes this by enabling teams to query all data types — from traditional rows
and columns of numbers to text, images, audio, and more — all while using SQL, the universal language they already know and love
for managing data.
By harnessing SQL with AI-powered functions in Snowflake, analysts can now readily access and analyze multi-modal data at scale,
eliminating data silos, consolidating tools, and combining traditional structured data with unstructured sources. This includes
enriching customer tables with chat transcripts, correlating sensor readings with inspection photos, and merging sales figures with
social media sentiment — enabling analysts to classify images, extract insights from call transcripts, and detect anomalies with ease.
The result is a fully integrated SQL experience across all data, unlocking deeper insights, faster decisions, and accelerated
innovation without the need for specialized AI skills or external services. Cortex AISQL delivers unified intelligence across the entire
organization.
Snowflake Accelerates Time to Value with AI-Powered Migrations
With SnowConvert AI, Snowflake is making one of the most tedious and time-consuming parts of digital transformation — data
warehouse migrations, business intelligence (BI) migrations, and ETL migrations — faster and smarter, without introducing
additional risk factors. With data ecosystem migration agents powered by Snowflake Cortex AI, SnowConvert AI enables
organizations to quickly and easily move from legacy data warehouses like Oracle, Teradata, Google BigQuery, and other cloud data
platforms to Snowflake.
By automating the conversion of code, BI reports, ETL tools, and validating the converted code and migrated data efficiently,
SnowConvert AI streamlines the migration process for data engineers. SnowConvert AI goes beyond just database migrations,
allowing customers to migrate their entire data ecosystem, while staying seamlessly supported and without disrupting critical
workflows — ultimately reducing risk, costs, and complexity at every step.
SnowConvert AI makes the code conversion and testing phases 2-3 times faster, significantly reducing time-to-delivery and
speeding up modernization efforts. By accelerating the path to modernization, Snowflake shortens the time between intention and
insight, so organizations can minimize migration timelines and start generating insights that drive results sooner.

Statement Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We report the following non-GAAP financial measures, which have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures
calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP Product gross profit, Operating income, Net income, Net income attributable to Snowflake Inc., and Net income
per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders— basic and diluted. Non-GAAP product gross profit, operating
income, net income, and net income attributable to Snowflake Inc. are each defined as the respective GAAP measure,
excluding, as applicable, the effect of (i) stock-based compensation-related charges, including employer payroll tax-related
items on employee stock transactions, (ii) amortization of acquired intangibles, (iii) expenses associated with acquisitions and
strategic investments, (iv) amortization of debt issuance costs, (v) restructuring charges, net of associated income and
recoveries, (vi) asset impairment related to office facility exit, net of associated sublease income, if any, (vii) adjustments
attributable to noncontrolling interest, and (viii) the related income tax effect of these adjustments as well as the non-
recurring income tax expense or benefit associated with acquisitions. Non-GAAP product gross margin is calculated as non-
GAAP product gross profit as a percentage of product revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin is calculated as non-GAAP
operating income as a percentage of revenue. Our non-GAAP net income per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common
stockholders—basic is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income attributable to Snowflake Inc. by the weighted-average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Our non-GAAP net income per share attributable to
Snowflake Inc. common stockholders—diluted is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income attributable to Snowflake Inc.
by the non-GAAP weighted-average number of diluted shares outstanding, which includes (a) the effect of all potentially
dilutive common stock equivalents (stock options, restricted stock units, employee stock purchase rights under our 2020
Employee Stock Purchase Plan), (b) the potential dilutive effect of the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes using the
if-converted method, and (c) the antidilutive impact, if any, of the Capped Calls entered into in connection with the Notes. The
Capped Calls are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Notes under
certain circumstances. Under GAAP, the antidilutive impact of the Capped Calls is not reflected in diluted shares outstanding
until exercised. The potential dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units with performance conditions not yet
satisfied is included in the non-GAAP weighted-average number of diluted shares at forecasted attainment levels to the
extent we believe it is probable that the performance conditions will be met. Amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest
were not material for all periods presented. We belieSvkeip ttho em pairne csoenntetanttion of operating results that exclude these items that are

and are unrelated to our core operations such that management does not consider them in evaluating the business
performance or making operating plans, provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of
our operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods.
Free cash flow. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and
equipment and capitalized software development costs. Cash outflows for employee payroll tax items related to the net share
settlement of equity awards are included in cash flow for financing activities and, as a result, do not have an effect on the
calculation of free cash flow. Free cash flow margin is calculated as free cash flow as a percentage of revenue. We believe
these measures provide useful supplemental information to investors because they are indicators of the strength and
performance of our core business operations.
Adjusted free cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as free cash flow plus (minus) net cash paid (received) on employer
and employee payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions. Employee payroll tax-related items on employee
stock transactions are generally pass-through transactions that are expected to have a net zero impact on free cash flow over
time, but that may impact free cash flow in any given fiscal quarter due to differences between the time that we receive funds
from our employees and the time we remit those funds to applicable tax authorities. We believe that excluding the effects of
these payroll tax-related items will enhance stockholders' ability to evaluate our free cash flow performance, including on a
quarter-over-quarter basis. Adjusted free cash flow margin is calculated as adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of revenue.
We believe these measures provide useful supplemental information to investors because they are indicators of the strength
and performance of our core business operations.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to
evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute
for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar
measures used by other companies. We encourage investors to carefully consider our results under GAAP, as well as our
supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand our business.
Please see the tables included at the end of this release for the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.
Key Business Metrics
We monitor our key business metrics, including (i) free cash flow and (ii) the other metrics set forth below to help us evaluate our
business and growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational
efficiencies. See the section titled “Statement Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for the definition of free cash flow.
The calculation of our key business metrics may differ from other similarly titled metrics used by other companies, securities
analysts, or investors.
Product Revenue. Product revenue is a key metric for us because we recognize revenue based on platform consumption,
which is inherently variable at our customers’ discretion, and not based on the amount and duration of contract terms.
Product revenue is primarily derived from the consumption of compute, storage, and data transfer resources by customers on
our platform. Customers have the flexibility to consume more than their contracted capacity during the contract term and
may have the ability to roll over unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity at
renewal. Our consumption-based business model distinguishes us from subscription-based software companies that generally
recognize revenue ratably over the contract term and may not permit rollover. Because customers have flexibility in the timing
of their consumption, which can exceed their contracted capacity or extend beyond the original contract term in many cases,
the amount of product revenue recognized in a given period is an important indicator of customer satisfaction and the value
derived from our platform. While customer use of our platform in any period is not necessarily indicative of future use, we
estimate future revenue using predictive models based on customers’ historical usage to plan and determine financial
forecasts. Product revenue excludes our professional services and other revenue.
Net Revenue Retention Rate. To calculate net revenue retention rate, we first specify a measurement period consisting of the
trailing two years from our current period end. Next, we define as our measurement cohort the population of customers
Skip to main content
under capacity contracts that used our platform at any point in the first month of the first year of the measurement period. 
The cohorts used to calculate net revenue retention rate include end-customers under a rReEsQeUllEeSrT aAr MraEnETgIeNmG WenITtH. MWAeN AtGhEeMnENT
calculate our net revenue retention rate as the quotient obtained by dividing our product revenue from this cohort in the
second year of the measurement period by our product revenue from this cohort in the first year of the measurement period.
Any customer in the cohort that did not use our platform in the second year remains in the calculation and contributes zero
product revenue in the second year. Our net revenue retention rate is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations,
spin-offs, and other market activity, and we present our net revenue retention rate for historical periods reflecting these
adjustments. Since we will continue to attribute the historical product revenue to the consolidated contract, consolidation of
capacity contracts within a customer’s organization typically will not impact our net revenue retention rate unless one of
those customers was not a customer at any point in the first month of the first year of the measurement period.
Customers with Trailing 12-Month Product Revenue Greater than $1 Million. To calculate the number of customers with
trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million, we count the number of customers under capacity arrangements
that contributed more than $1 million in product revenue in the trailing 12 months. For purposes of determining our customer
count, we treat each customer account, including accounts for end-customers under a reseller arrangement, that has at least
one corresponding capacity contract as a unique customer, and a single organization with multiple divisions, segments, or
subsidiaries may be counted as multiple customers. We do not include customers that consume our platform only under on-
demand arrangements for purposes of determining our customer count. Our customer count is subject to adjustments for
acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity, and we present our customer count for historical periods
reflecting these adjustments.
Forbes Global 2000 Customers. Our Forbes Global 2000 customer count is a subset of our customer count based on the
2025 Forbes Global 2000 list. Our Forbes Global 2000 customer count is subject to adjustments for annual updates to the list
by Forbes, as well as acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity with respect to such customers, and we
present our Forbes Global 2000 customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments.
Remaining Performance Obligations. Remaining performance obligations (RPO) represent the amount of contracted future
revenue that has not yet been recognized, including (i) deferred revenue and (ii) non-cancelable contracted amounts that will
be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. RPO excludes performance obligations from on-demand
arrangements and certain time and materials contracts that are billed in arrears. Portions of RPO that are not yet invoiced and
are denominated in foreign currencies are revalued into U.S. dollars each period based on the applicable period-end exchange
rates. RPO is not necessarily indicative of future product revenue growth because it does not account for the timing of
customers’ consumption or their consumption of more than their contracted capacity. Moreover, RPO is influenced by a
number of factors, including the timing and size of renewals, the timing and size of purchases of additional capacity, average
contract terms, seasonality, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the extent to which customers are permitted to
roll over unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity at renewal. Due to these
factors, it is important to review RPO in conjunction with product revenue and other financial metrics disclosed elsewhere
herein.

Snowflake Achieves Department of Defense IL5 Authorization,
Furthering Position as the Trusted AI Data Cloud for Government
and Defense Customers
April 10, 2025
Snowflake also launches dedicated United States Public Sector entity, reinforcing commitment to Federal, Defense, and aerospace
customers
No-Headquarters/BOZEMAN, Mont.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), the AI Data Cloud company, today
announced it has achieved Department of Defense (DOD) Impact Level 5 (IL5) Provisional Authorization (PA) on AWS GovCloud
US-West. This authorization enables Snowflake to offer IL5 authorized solutions to organizations requiring the highest levels of
protection for Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) within the DOD and related agencies. It also allows the DOD to leverage
advanced data analytics, collaborate securely, and generate AI-driven insights on Snowflake's platform to enhance mission-critical
operations, accelerate digital transformation initiatives, and achieve cognitive advantage. This milestone comes as Snowflake
expands its government-focused operations with the launch of Snowflake Public Sector, Inc., a dedicated U.S. Public Sector
subsidiary, emphasizing its commitment to serving Federal, Defense, State and local government, and education entities.
The IL5 PA from the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) can be used by all agencies and military services within the DOD,
including the Army, Navy, Air Force, Space Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and Combatant Commands. It also extends to
industry mission partners and eligible State and Federal agencies seeking the secure data storage, collaboration, and analytics
capabilities of Snowflake’s unified data platform.
“The Department of Defense’s mission to enhance readiness and drive innovation demands secure, data-centric solutions,"" said
Matthew Rose, Head of Corporate Government Relations at Snowflake. ""Achieving IL5 authorization underscores Snowflake’s
commitment to providing these solutions to Servicemembers, customers, and industry partners. This milestone allows us to bring
secure and efficient enterprise solutions to controlled unclassified workloads across the national security community, improving

readiness, ensuring fiscal accountability, rebuilding the military and industrial base, and delivering the best systems available.”

 REQUEST A MEETING WITH MANAGEMENT
With IL5, Snowflake will enable the DOD to modernize and accelerate their data cloud migration by protecting and sharing mission
critical data across the cloud. This reinforces Snowflake’s commitment to compliance and support of the warfighter and DOD
missions globally. With this authorization, the DOD will have access to enhanced data capabilities in support of operations that
advance national security objectives. Example use cases include, but are not limited to:
Financial Management: World-class financial management that accelerates mission readiness by offering a unified budgeting
source, near real-time insights, enhanced accountability, comprehensive reporting, and efficient cost management.
Enterprise Business Operations: Maximized business and enterprise workload performance through a fully managed, centrally
governed, and efficiency-driven multi-cloud data platform.
Logistics & Supply Chain: Improved inventory management and operations through increased visibility, decision support,
operational efficiency, and demand forecasting.
Cybersecurity: A holistic platform for unified data, near unlimited visibility, and powerful analytics which helps eliminate blind
spots in security data, strengthens incident response through unified monitoring, and provides a comprehensive repository for
all security data.
Open Source Intelligence (OSINT): Enrich data from publicly available sources to accelerate decision making, conduct policy
research, gather sentiment analysis, and perform economic forecasting.
These use cases represent just a few of the many mission-critical applications where Snowflake's IL5 authorization can support the
DOD and broader government operations. DOD customers can also leverage Snowflake's comprehensive platform capabilities,
including built-in governance through Snowflake Horizon and advanced security features. The platform delivers extensive data
storage, analysis, and support for AI/ML capabilities, all designed to support diverse workloads across the national security
landscape.
Snowflake’s IL5 authorization comes on the heels of establishing Snowflake Public Sector, Inc., a subsidiary dedicated to serving
customers in the Federal, State and local government, national security, and education sectors. The formation of this entity
underscores Snowflake’s long-term commitment to investing in and addressing the unique needs of the Public Sector industry and
will allow Snowflake to better serve customers in mission categories who deal with sensitive and highly controlled information that
require clearances to support. By providing tailored solutions to meet the complex requirements of Government agencies and their
partners, Snowflake is expanding how these organizations can better serve citizens and constituents.
Organizations interested in Snowflake's Government and Defense capabilities can begin leveraging these solutions immediately.
Where eligible, current Snowflake customers can work with their account teams to enable IL5 capabilities, while new customers can

""The magic of building on Snowflake is everything we didn't have to do. We didn't have to build a separate AI platform or worry
about core security and governance from scratch,” said Assaf Henkin, Co-Founder and CEO at Jedify. “Snowflake handles all the
complex infrastructure, so we can focus entirely on delivering the contextual data layers, powered by our Semantic Fusion™
technology, enabling powerful, enterprise-grade AI applications. It's the fastest path from an idea to a trusted product.""
Fueling Venture-Backed Innovation
To accelerate the growth of venture-backed startups, Snowflake is evolving how it works with VCs and investment firms, which
includes Altimeter, Amplify, Blackstone, Capital One Ventures, Coatue, Greylock Partners, ICONIQ, IVP, Madrona Ventures, Menlo
Ventures, Redpoint Ventures and more, plus its first strategic VC relationship in the Asia Pacific-Japan region with the Asan Nanum
Foundation. This collaboration provides firms with early insight into cutting-edge AI startups building on Snowflake. They also gain
free Snowflake usage for their portfolio companies1, combined with opportunities to work with Snowflake's industry and technical
experts. This helps remove a key barrier to building on an enterprise-grade platform so startups can compete with incumbents
without massive upfront investment.
""Snowflake sits at the epicenter of the AI and data revolution, giving them an unparalleled vantage point to spot emerging trends,”
said Pauline Yang, Partner at Altimeter. “By working with Snowflake, we’re equipping our founders with the knowledge and tools to
build secure, AI-native applications that solve customer problems from day one.”

Snowflake for Startups provides a comprehensive toolkit designed to help new companies build, launch and grow through its:
Go-To-Market Engine: Startups get access to more than 12,000 potential customers through the Snowflake Marketplace to
accelerate growth and unlock new monetization opportunities for their applications and products.
Snowflake Startup Accelerator: By providing builders with access to credits, engineering support and unparalleled go-to-
market guidance, the Snowflake Startup Accelerator has helped participants launch 28 live products. The program’s growing
success is underscored by a 304% increase in program applications this year.
Snowflake Ventures: Snowflake Ventures is on track to accelerate its investment pace by over 30% this year, a move that is
actively fueling the next generation of startups and will grow its total number of portfolio companies and exits to over 65. This
includes over 15 early stage companies Snowflake Ventures has invested in through the company’s startup programs.
Innovation and Event Spaces at SVAI Hub: With its prime location in Menlo Park, the SVAI Hub will provide dedicated
coworking and event spaces for startups to deepen their relationship with Snowflake while being in close proximity to key VC
firms and leading AI companies. The SVAI Hub’s coworking space expects to launch next month with a first cohort of over a
dozen startups.
“Snowflake for Startups has supported us at every stage, including through investment from Snowflake Ventures,” said Alexis
Steinman, Co-CEO at Maxa, winner of a Snowflake Startup Challenge and more recently a Data Drivers Award. “Snowflake was the
best platform to build our patent-pending reasoning and verification technology that extends the reach of generative AI to
mainstream finance and business teams that struggle with complex systems of record. Snowflake's partnership lets us focus on our
'secret sauce' while delivering immediate enterprise-grade trust, scalability and frontier capabilities.""

Snowflake, Salesforce, dbt Labs, and More, Revolutionize Data
Readiness for AI with Open Semantic Interchange Initiative
September 23, 2025
The Open Semantic Interchange initiative aims to create a universal semantic data framework for all companies to standardize
their fragmented data definitions with an open, vendor-neutral specification
Ecosystem leaders including Snowflake, Salesforce, dbt Labs, RelationalAI, with the support from industry partners including
BlackRock, are rallying behind this first-of-its-kind collaboration, bringing the wider ecosystem together to accelerate AI and
BI adoption with semantic metadata interoperability
No-Headquarters/BOZEMAN, Mont.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), the AI Data Cloud company in partnership
with leading industry partners and ecosystem vendors, including Salesforce, BlackRock, dbt Labs, and RelationalAI, announced a
bold commitment to lead the Open Semantic Interchange (OSI), a new open source initiative. In today’s AI era, fragmented data
semantics across tools and platforms create a major roadblock for both human and AI-enabled analysis. This initiative addresses
that challenge head-on by introducing a common, vendor-neutral semantic model specification that standardizes how semantic
metadata is defined and shared — ensuring consistent business logic across AI and business intelligence (BI) applications.
“At Snowflake, we’ve long believed that interoperability and
open standards are essential to unlocking the full potential of
AI with your data,” said Christian Kleinerman, EVP of Product,
Snowflake. “With the Open Semantic Interchange initiative,
we are proud to be leading the charge alongside our partners
to solve a foundational challenge for AI — the lack of a
common semantic standard. This initiative reflects the industry
coming together, not competing, to solve shared challenges
and build a more connected, open ecosystem for all.”

Advancing Interoperability and AI Innovation

 REQUEST A MEETING WITH MANAGEMENT
As AI transforms how businesses use data, the need for consistent semantics has never been more urgent. Today, every tool
interprets business metrics and metadata differently — causing confusion, slowing adoption, and eroding trust in AI-driven insights.
The OSI addresses this challenge head-on with a unified, vendor-neutral specification for business, domain, and industry semantics.
With OSI, semantic data is interoperable and reliable across platforms, empowering organizations to scale AI and BI with greater
confidence, speed, and trust.
Key goals of the initiative include:
Enhancing interoperability across tools and platforms: In a fragmented data landscape, organizations often rely on a
patchwork of AI, BI, and analytics tools. OSI establishes a shared semantic standard so all tools can “speak the same
language,” giving companies the flexibility to adopt best-of-breed technologies without losing consistency in metrics or
business logic.
Accelerating the adoption of AI and BI applications: Many organizations struggle to scale AI and BI because inconsistent
semantics undermine trust. By standardizing how semantics are defined and exchanged, OSI ensures data is governed,
consistent, and context-rich — enabling more accurate, trustworthy AI insights and faster adoption.
Streamlining operations and reducing complexity: Without a shared semantic specification, data and AI teams often spend
weeks reconciling conflicting definitions or duplicating work across platforms. The OSI eliminates this challenge with a
common specification, reducing overhead and freeing data and AI teams to focus on innovation instead of troubleshooting.
Leading Industry Vendors Charge Toward an Open, Interoperable Future
Fragmented data definitions remain one of the biggest barriers to AI adoption, making a shared open standard essential to ensuring
semantic consistency wherever data is used. Rather than addressing this challenge in silos, industry and ecosystem leaders are co-
leading the Open Semantic Interchange alongside a growing coalition of partners, including: Alation, Atlan, BlackRock, Blue Yonder,
Cube, dbt Labs, Elementum AI, Hex, Honeydew, Mistral AI, Omni, RelationalAI, Salesforce, Select Star, Sigma, Snowflake, and
ThoughtSpot.
With momentum building as more participants join, this joint effort marks a decisive shift away from closed, single-vendor
approaches toward a future built on interoperability, standardization, and open source collaboration. Together, the industry is laying
the foundation for trusted, scalable AI adoption and unlocking the next wave of innovation.
Quotes From OSI Members:
“The future of AI depends on trust—and trust starts with consistent, reliable data,” said Southard Jones, Chief Product Officer,
Tableau. “By co-leading the Open Semantic Interchange with Snowflake and our partners, we’re building the foundation every
AI agent and BI application needs: a common semantic framework that preserves meaning across platforms. This is the
Rosetta Stone for business data, ensuring our customers can harness trusted insights with confidence, no matter where their
data lives.”
“Our focus at dbt Labs has always been to empower data teams to work more efficiently,” said Ryan Segar, Chief Product
Officer, dbt Labs. “We see the Open Semantic Interchange as a natural extension of this, as it aims to solve the foundational
problem of siloed and incompatible data semantics. By creating a universal language for data definitions, this open source
initiative will help data practitioners ensure consistency and reliability, which is essential for scaling AI initiatives.”
“At BlackRock, we're constantly seeking ways to enhance data interoperability and drive innovation for our clients,” said
Diwakar Goel, Global Head of Aladdin Data, BlackRock. “The Aladdin platform unifies the investment management process
through a common data language across public and private markets, helping clients unlock value and scale. We are excited to
be part of the Open Semantic Interchange to help establish a common, vendor-neutral specification that will not only
streamline data exchange but also accelerate the adoption of AI and business intelligence applications across the financial
industry.""

platform, customers can now harness accelerated computing with their existing Python workflows, eliminating complexity and
dramatically speeding up AI development.”
The integration makes NVIDIA’s powerful CUDA-X Data Science (CUDA-X DS) ecosystem, an open-source suite of GPU-
accelerated libraries, accessible directly through the Snowflake Container Runtime, a pre-built environment for large-scale machine
learning development. Organizations now have the power to tackle computationally demanding challenges, such as:
Large-Scale Topic Modeling: Reducing the time to process and cluster massive tabular datasets—such as millions of product
reviews—from hours on a CPU to minutes on a GPU.
Computational Genomics Workflows: Significantly speeding up the analysis of vast, high-dimensional sequences, allowing
researchers to rapidly perform classification tasks (e.g., predicting gene families) and focus on insights rather than low level
GPU computing.
The integration builds on Snowflake and NVIDIA’s continued collaboration to power generative AI capabilities within the AI Data
Cloud. This new step further solidifies Snowflake’s commitment to deliver cutting-edge performance for all phases of the data and
AI lifecycle. The companies will continue to work closely to provide Snowflake customers with seamless access to some of the most

built for their specific needs, while providing the broader industry with seamless, secure connectivity across their data and AI 
ecosystems.  REQUEST A MEETING WITH MANAGEMENT
“The financial services industry has long been a leader in embracing new technology, and AI is no exception. However, the industry
faces unique challenges in navigating fragmented data, robust compliance requirements, and the need for airtight security and
governance,” said Baris Gultekin, VP of AI, Snowflake. “By bringing AI directly to where their data already lives and enabling secure
interoperability with remote agents, Snowflake is making it easier for highly regulated industries like financial services to power
business-critical use cases and tap into a unified ecosystem of best-of-breed data, AI, and apps.”
Introducing Cortex AI for Financial Services
Cortex AI for Financial Services enables enterprise-ready agents to accelerate complex financial tasks — including market analysis,
quantitative research, fraud detection, customer support, and claims management — saving enterprises time, reducing operational
costs, and delivering faster insights. Snowflake’s MCP Server extends this capability by enabling industry-wide interoperability,
securely connecting to Snowflake data, as well as third-party data and apps.
The Cortex AI for Financial Services ecosystem offers high-quality, trusted data from leading financial data providers and publishers
that organizations can seamlessly integrate with their AI apps and agents — including structured data providers like CB Insights,
Cotality™, Deutsche Börse, MSCI, and Nasdaq eVestment® through Sharing of Semantic Views (generally available soon); and
unstructured data publishers like CB Insights, FactSet, Investopedia, The Associated Press, and The Washington Post through
Cortex Knowledge Extensions (now generally available). By combining industry-specific data from leading financial institutions and
publishers — such as market analysis, expert research, business content, and news — with their own proprietary data in Snowflake,
financial services companies can get deeper insights, accuracy, and results from their AI.
Within the Cortex AI for Financial Services suite, the following product features empower finance professionals to accelerate
business-critical use cases, including:
Complex Machine Learning Workflows: Financial services firms rely on data scientists for risk modeling, forecasting, trading
analytics, and compliance, but much of their time is spent on data preparation and repetitive coding. Snowflake Data Science
Agent acts as an AI coding agent, automating data cleaning, feature engineering, model prototyping, and validation so teams
can move from raw data to production-ready models faster. This means automating and streamlining models that underpin
quantitative research, fraud detection, customer 360, and underwriting workflows.
Analysis of Unstructured Data: Financial institutions sit on mountains of unstructured data such as market research, earnings
call transcripts, and transaction details that require manual review or complex ETL before analysis. With Snowflake Cortex
AISQL(in public preview) adding functions like AI-powered extraction and transcription(in public preview), users can efficiently
process and get insights from documents, audio, and images at scale — transforming end-to-end workflows like customer
service, investment analytics, claims management, and next-best action.
Easy Access to Flexible Insights: While Data Science Agent and Cortex AISQL accelerate workflows for technical and research
teams, Snowflake Intelligence(in public preview) offers business users an intuitive conversational interface to gain insights
using natural language from data stored in Snowflake, as well as third-party data, apps, and agents — allowing users to quickly
uncover actionable insights from both structured tables and unstructured documents. This democratizes access to data and
insights across financial institutions, and eliminates the technical overhead that slows down business decision-making.
Snowflake MCP Server Extends to All Industries for Connected, Interoperable AI
AI agents extend the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by interacting with external tools, completing complex workflows,
and understanding the broader context of an organization. However, connecting these AI agents to existing enterprise systems has
presented challenges, often requiring teams to spin up customized solutions for each integration, which slows down AI adoption.
MCP has emerged in recent months as a solution to this problem, providing a standardized way for LLMs to integrate with data,
APIs, and services. With the introduction of Snowflake MCP Server, enterprises can:
Enable MCP Server to connect with tools built on Snowflake: Snowflake MCP Server connects Cortex Analyst and Cortex
Search to external AI agents through a standards-based MCP interface, unifying structured and unstructured data retrieval.
This simplifies enterprises’ application architecture and eliminates the need for custom integrations — accelerating the

can now connect with Snowflake data — as well as third-party data shares from Snowflake Marketplace through Cortex
Knowledge Extensions — enabling interoperability with the broader AI ecosystem.
Sharing of third-party data is now possible alongside tools, apps, and data sources that enterprises are already using, without
sacrificing security or governance. Snowflake MCP Server can be used to connect with a variety of agentic apps and platforms,
including Anthropic, Augment Code, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, Azure AI Foundry, CrewAI, Cursor, Devin by Cognition, Glean,
Kumo, Mistral AI, Salesforce’s Agentforce, UiPath, Windsurf, Workday, and WRITER.
Comments on the News:
""Enterprises are moving from AI pilots to production, but until now, securely connecting AI to proprietary data has been a
critical barrier,"" said Jonathan Pelosi, Head of Industry, Financial Services, Anthropic. ""Our partnership with Snowflake helps
solve this by using MCP to connect each organization's governed data directly to Claude. Customers can now use Claude's
advanced reasoning on both structured analytics and unstructured documents via Cortex Analyst and Cortex Search, while
maintaining enterprise security standards. With Claude and Snowflake, our joint customers are turning proprietary data into
competitive advantage.""
“The next wave of enterprise AI hinges upon orchestrating collaborative crews of specialized agents to automate complex
processes. For these agentic workflows to succeed in the enterprise, they must be grounded in secure, high-quality data,” said
João Moura, Co-Founder and CEO, CrewAI. “Snowflake's launch of a managed MCP Server provides the essential, secure
pipeline for our agent crews to access, analyze, and act upon governed data within the AI Data Cloud. For our joint customers,
this partnership moves multi-agent systems from a theoretical concept to a practical, enterprise-ready reality, and we are
thrilled to be a launch partner.”
“The intelligence of any AI coding assistant is fundamentally constrained by the context it can access,"" said Ricky Doar, Head
of Field Engineering, Cursor. “A managed MCP server like Snowflake's is a rich live data environment for tools like Cursor to
consume essential data context and write faster, more accurate, and more secure production-ready code.""
""As a leading market data provider, we are proud to be on the cutting-edge of industry-wide advances like MCP. Providing our
clients access to AI-ready data products represents a significant step forward for our clients, providing the technological
foundation to unify and enrich data within modern cloud environments,” said John Costigan, Executive Vice President, Chief
Data Officer at FactSet. “This collaboration underscores FactSet’s commitment to equipping financial institutions with the
tools necessary to navigate evolving markets, manage risk more effectively, and foster enduring value creation.""
“At Ramp, our mission is to help businesses save time and money. A critical part of that is deeply understanding their needs
from the thousands of pieces of feedback we receive,” said Ian Macomber, Head of Analytics, Ramp. “With Snowflake Cortex
AI, we can securely tap into and analyze our unstructured customer data, allowing teams across Ramp to ask questions in
plain English and get instant answers. Snowflake makes it easy to democratize data-driven decision-making, which enables us
to innovate faster and build the best possible platform for our customers.”
""We're excited to expand our partnership with Snowflake to deliver agent interoperability through protocols like MCP. This
will enable deeper cross-platform connectivity and power more intelligent agentic experiences within Agentforce,” said Gary
Lerhaupt, VP, Product Architecture, Agentforce at Salesforce. “Customers will easily be able to discover and connect to

Snowflake Intelligence and Data Science Agent Deliver The Next
Frontier of Data Agents for Enterprise AI and ML
June 3, 2025
Business users can now harness AI data agents to analyze, understand, and act on structured and unstructured data with
Snowflake Intelligence, without technical overhead
Data scientists can leverage Data Science Agent to automate their ML workflows, boost productivity, and accelerate time-to-
production for ML use cases
Over 5,200 customers from companies like BlackRock, Luminate, and Penske Logistics are using Snowflake to deploy AI
solutions across their businesses
SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), the AI Data Cloud company, today announced at its annual user
conference, Snowflake Summit 2025, new agentic AI innovations that bridge the gap between enterprise data and business action,
making AI and ML workflows easy, connected, and trusted for technical and non-technical users alike.
Snowflake Intelligence (public preview soon) offers business
users and data professionals a unified conversational
experience — powered by intelligent data agents — to ask
natural language questions and instantly uncover actionable
insights from both structured tables and unstructured
documents. Snowflake is also unveiling Data Science Agent
(private preview soon), an agentic companion that boosts data
scientists’ productivity by automating routine ML model
development tasks. These innovations enable users to simplify

language interactions within Snowflake. 
 REQUEST A MEETING WITH MANAGEMENT
“AI agents are a major leap from traditional automation or chatbots, but in order to deploy them at scale, businesses need an AI-
ready information ecosystem. This means enterprises must be able to unite data silos, maintain enterprise-grade security and
compliance, and have easy ways to adopt and build agents,"" said Baris Gultekin, Head of AI, Snowflake. ""Snowflake Intelligence
breaks down these barriers by democratizing the ability to extract meaningful intelligence from an organization’s entire enterprise
data estate — structured and unstructured data alike. This isn't just about accessing data, it's about empowering every employee to
make faster, smarter decisions with all of their business context at their fingertips.""
“At WHOOP, our mission is to unlock human performance and healthspan, and data is central to everything we do. Snowflake
Intelligence marks a big step forward in our ability to be a data-first organization, ensuring that all employees can access insights
without relying on analytics teams as the intermediary,” said Matt Luizzi, Sr. Director of Business Analytics, WHOOP. “By
eliminating the technical barriers to gleaning the insights we need for decision-making, our analytics teams can now shift from
manual data retrieval tasks to more strategic, predictive, and value-generating work.”
Snowflake Intelligence Reimagines Business Intelligence, Without the Overhead
Today, organizations are plagued by inefficient decision-making due to disjointed data governance, silos between data formats, and
a shortage of technical data analysts who can code and synthesize information across the business. Snowflake Intelligence
eliminates these operational challenges, allowing non-technical users and business teams to have conversations with their
enterprise data in natural language — all without writing a single line of code.
Running directly inside organizations’ existing Snowflake environment, Snowflake Intelligence inherits all security controls, data
masking, and governance policies automatically. It unifies data across sources including Snowflake, Box, Google Drive, Salesforce
Data Cloud via Zero Copy, Workday, Zendesk, and more, using the new Snowflake Openflow to bring together insights from
spreadsheets, documents, images, and databases simultaneously. By leveraging natural language prompts, the data agents powering
Snowflake Intelligence can generate visualizations and assist users in taking action on insights. From analyzing business metrics to
looking up helpful internal knowledge, Snowflake Intelligence enables every employee to easily access and harness the full potential
of their company’s data. Snowflake Intelligence can also access third-party knowledge through Cortex Knowledge Extensions
(generally available soon) on Snowflake Marketplace, and incorporate expert content from Packt, Stack Overflow, the USA TODAY
Network, and more to further contextualize and enrich responses.
Snowflake Intelligence is powered by state-of-the-art large language models from Anthropic and OpenAI, running inside the
Snowflake perimeter, and is powered by Cortex Agents (generally available soon) under the hood — all delivered through an
intuitive, no-code interface that helps provide transparency and explainability.
“By integrating Claude's reasoning capabilities directly into Snowflake's platform, we're further eliminating the traditional barriers
between data and insights. Business users can now have natural conversations with their enterprise data, while data scientists can
automate complex ML workflows — all through simple natural language interactions,” said Michael Gerstenhaber, VP, Product
Management, Anthropic. “This demonstrates how Claude's advanced reasoning can democratize AI while maintaining the
enterprise-grade security and governance that organizations require.”
Data Science Agent Automates Tedious ML Tasks, Saving Hours of Manual Work
Data scientists spend lengthy cycles on developing and troubleshooting their ML workflows, leading to operational bottlenecks and
fewer ML models making their way to production. Now, Snowflake is bringing agentic AI to ML workflows with Data Science Agent
to boost productivity for ML teams by slashing hours of manual work.
Data Science Agent uses Anthropic’s Claude to break down problems associated with ML workflows into distinct steps, such as
data analysis, data preparation, feature engineering, and training. Combining advanced techniques such as multi-step reasoning,
contextual understanding, and action execution, Data Science Agent provides verified solutions in the form of fully functional ML
pipelines that can be easily executed from a Snowflake Notebook. With suggested improvements, or with user provided follow-ups,
Data Science Agent helps users easily iterate to the next-best version. By automating this tedious work, data science teams save
hours of time that they would typically spend on experimeSnkitpa ttioo mna oinr c doentbeuntgging — and can instead focus on higher-impact

Snowflake Marketplace Adds Agentic Products and AI-Ready

With Cortex Knowledge Extensions, enterprises can now enrich their AI apps and agents with real-time news and content
from USA TODAY, the USA TODAY Network, Stack Overflow, and more
Customers can leverage sharing of Semantic Models to find, share, and integrate AI-ready structured data into agentic
workflows
Users can now discover, install, and purchase third-party Agentic Native Apps on Snowflake Marketplace, which harness
agentic AI to securely bring together customer and provider data from within Snowflake’s governance perimeter
SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), the AI Data Cloud company, today announced at its annual user
conference, Snowflake Summit 2025, new agentic products on Snowflake Marketplace that accelerate agentic AI adoption across
the enterprise. Cortex Knowledge Extensions (generally available soon) on Snowflake Marketplace enables enterprises to enrich
their AI apps and agents with proprietary unstructured data from third-party providers — all while allowing providers to protect
their intellectual property and ensure proper attribution. This includes a selection of business articles and content from The
Associated Press, which will help users further enhance the usefulness of results in their AI systems. Real-time news and content
from USA TODAY and the USA TODAY Network is also available through Cortex Knowledge Extensions, alongside third-party
content from publishers like CB Insights, Packt, and Stack Overflow.
In addition, Snowflake unveiled sharing of Semantic Models
(now in private preview), which allows users to easily integrate
AI-ready structured data within their Snowflake Cortex AI apps
and agents — both from internal teams or third-party providers
like CARTO, CB Insights, Cotality™ powered by Bobsled,
Deutsche Börse, IPinfo, and truestar. With Snowflake’s latest
collaboration innovations, enterprises can accelerate their AI

perimeter of the AI Data Cloud.
Snowflake Marketplace Adds Agentic Products and AI-Ready Data from “Building powerful AI apps and agents at scale hinges on
Leading News, Research, and Market Data Providers enterprises having access to not only high-quality and relevant
internal and external data, but also the business semantics of
that data in order to deliver trusted AI results,” said Prasanna Krishnan, Head of Apps & Collaboration and Horizon, Snowflake.
“Snowflake is raising the bar on enterprise-wide collaboration, making it even easier for customers to fuel their AI initiatives with
AI-ready data and leverage Agentic Native Apps that they can bring to their data, without copying or moving data. Our latest
innovations enable teams to turn possibilities into reality with data and AI, all without worrying about security and governance risk.”
“The USA TODAY Network is the largest local-to-national publishing and digital media organization in the country, with 195 million
average monthly unique visitors relying on our trusted content to stay connected to the stories and cultural moments happening in
their communities,” said Renn Turiano, Chief Consumer and Product Officer, Gannett | USA TODAY Network. “We are thrilled to join
the Snowflake Marketplace among the first news publishers to provide our trusted content for enterprise AI use in an equitable
manner that respects our intellectual property rights while ensuring compensation for the value created for end users. This marks
an important step forward in establishing a mutually beneficial ecosystem for AI companies, enterprises, content owners, and
publishers to strategically partner, while driving innovation forward.”
The First AI-Ready Content Marketplace for Enterprise AI
Today, many enterprise AI systems lack access to real-time feeds of external content and knowledge — limiting their ability to
provide accurate and context-rich responses. Conversely, licensed content owners want to ensure their content isn’t being used for
AI training without compensation or attribution. Cortex Knowledge Extensions addresses these challenges by providing the first
mutually beneficial marketplace of its kind where content owners and publishers like The Associated Press and USA TODAY
Network can monetize their content for enterprise AI use with licensing terms — ensuring that content owners and publishers are
compensated appropriately and enterprises can harness licensed proprietary knowledge in their AI apps.
Content owners and publishers can list their content like news articles, textbooks, and research papers on Snowflake Marketplace,
which enterprises can then purchase to further contextualize their AI-powered apps and agents in Cortex AI — including Cortex
Agents (generally available soon), Cortex Search, and Snowflake Intelligence (public preview soon). This allows enterprises to
harness real-time insights across news, research, and publications to enrich their AI outputs — all alongside the wealth of
proprietary knowledge in their own organization’s documents.
Cortex Knowledge Extensions permit the access of content only through retrieval-augmented generation and are powered by
Snowflake’s underlying Zero-ETL Sharing functionality, ensuring that content owners and publishers have the ability to revoke
access to their content at any time. In addition, content appears alongside clear attribution and links to the original source for
increased reliability and accuracy.
Sharing of Semantic Models Saves Enterprises Time and Ensures Trustworthy AI at Scale
A critical step for ensuring AI is accurate and trustworthy is the creation of semantic models for structured, tabular data. Semantic
models provide large language models with definitions and an understanding of structured data and associated business concepts,
enabling users to ask questions in natural language and get meaningful answers.
Now with sharing of Semantic Models, enterprises can easily share and access data along with semantic models, from internal
teams through the Internal Marketplace, or third-party providers through Snowflake Marketplace — all while maintaining
governance and version control. By mapping their internal data to these shared definitions, enterprises can drive more consistent
decision-making and accelerate time-to-insight. In turn, business teams no longer depend on the availability of data engineers or
data scientists to build reports or run ad-hoc queries. With Cortex AI-ready data products on Snowflake Marketplace, enterprises
can tap into industry standard intelligence.
Sharing of Semantic Models eliminates the time and effort teams spend creating semantic models, while still ensuring that AI
systems generate accurate, high-quality, and context-rich responses. Users can then talk to their data with sharing of Semantic
Models directly within their AI apps and agents in Cortex ASkI,i pi ntoc lmuadiinn cgo nCteonrttex Agents, Cortex Analyst, or Snowflake Intelligence.

Snowflake Unveils Apache Iceberg™ Innovations, Giving
Enterprises the Best of Open Data and AI-Ready Performance
April 8, 2025
Customers now get the best of both worlds: Iceberg’s flexibility and interoperability coupled with Snowflake’s powerful
platform to make their data easy, connected, and trusted
Thousands of customers including Illumina, Komodo Health, Medidata, and WHOOP can now easily activate open-format
data with best-in-class performance
No-Headquarters/BOZEMAN, Mont.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), the AI Data Cloud company, announced that
it is bringing its core capabilities — unparalleled performance, secure data sharing, and data protection — to Apache Iceberg™
tables1, one of the fastest-growing open table formats, empowering organizations to activate data faster with zero data movement
and open interoperability. As a result, Snowflake customers can now seamlessly accelerate their open lakehouse strategies,
unlocking data access and analysis across open and managed environments in order to build, scale, and share advanced insights and
AI-powered apps faster.
Until now, organizations have been forced to make tradeoffs
when it comes to managing their data — relying on integrated
data platforms or opting for open, interoperable data formats
like parquet. With Snowflake's full support for Apache Iceberg
tables, customers now gain the best of both worlds. Users can
store, manage, and analyze their data in an open, interoperable
format, while still benefiting from Snowflake's easy, connected,
and trusted platform. All of this happens without vendor lock-
in, enabling thousands of global customers with unparalleled

data, and ultimately propel their AI strategies forward.

“The future of data is open, but it also needs to be easy,” said Christian Kleinerman, EVP of ProdRuEQcUt,E SSnT Ao wMEflEaTkINeG. “WCITuHs MtoAmNAeGrEsMENT
shouldn’t have to choose between open formats and best-in-class performance or business continuity. With Snowflake’s latest
Iceberg tables innovations, customers can work with their open data exactly as they would with data stored in the Snowflake
platform, all while removing complexity and preserving Snowflake’s enterprise-grade performance and security.”
Snowflake’s enhanced Iceberg tables support can be used to accelerate:
Lakehouse Analytics: Customers can now experience the same compute engine of Snowflake’s native table format on Iceberg
tables, and apply Search Optimization Service (general availability soon) or Query Acceleration Service (general availability
soon) on Iceberg tables for enhanced query performance. With Snowflake’s managed Iceberg tables, customers gain the
flexibility of open storage formats while preserving the industry-leading price-performance of Snowflake’s AI Data Cloud.
Snowflake is actively collaborating with the Apache Iceberg community to launch support for VARIANT data types.
Comprehensive Security and Governance, with Built-In Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery: Snowflake brings
seamless security to Iceberg tables, providing powerful, intuitive controls to keep open lakehouse environments secure and
easy to manage, while enabling customer compliance. Customers get the best of both worlds — open data flexibility with
built-in security. Snowflake is also extending its reliable data replication and syncing to Iceberg tables (in private preview),
ensuring that in the case of a system failure, cyberattack, or other disasters, companies can quickly restore their data without
major disruptions, all while supporting open lakehouse architectures.
Data Sharing:By bringing Snowflake’s secure data sharing technology to Iceberg tables, customers can access, share,
distribute, and monetize their data seamlessly, just as they do with native Snowflake table formats.
Driving the Future of Open Source and Data Innovation
Snowflake is deeply invested in advocating for open standards and community-driven open source projects that enhance data
interoperability and transparency. In fact, 35% of Snowflake’s acquisitions over the last four years have been companies with
technologies that strengthen open data ecosystems, underscoring the company’s investment in openness.
Notable open source projects that Snowflake contributes to include:
Apache IcebergTM: Snowflake’s contributions to Iceberg enable efficient, governed data lake management with schema
evolution, partitioning, and transaction management.
Apache NiFi: Built on NiFi, Datavolo (acquired by Snowflake in 2024)simplifies ingestion, transformation, and real-time
pipeline management.
Apache PolarisTM (Incubating):Designed to overcome vendor lock-in challenges,Apache PolarisTM (Incubating)ensures
enterprise security and Iceberg interoperability across major cloud providers.
Modin: Snowflake accelerates pandas workloads with Modin (acquired by Snowflake in 2023), enabling seamless scaling
without code change.
Streamlit:Snowflake’s integration with Streamlit (acquired by Snowflake in 2022) allows users to build and share interactive
web applications, data dashboards, and visualizations with ease.
TruEra: TruEra (acquired by Snowflake in 2024) boosts AI explainability and model performance monitoring for bias detection,
compliance, and performance insights.

Snowflake Delivers the Enterprise Lakehouse with Enhanced
Open Data Access and Flexibility for Agentic AI
November 4, 2025
New advancements to Snowflake Horizon Catalog offer thousands of customers and partners, including Merkle and
RelationalAI, the universal AI catalog that provides context and governance for AI across all data
Businesses can integrate their entire data ecosystem for agentic AI with Snowflake Openflow, and deliver immediate,
interactive insights with Interactive Tables and Warehouses
Snowflake is making it even easier to consolidate infrastructure and build agentic AI with Snowflake Postgres, bringing
developers’ preferred database to the platform enterprises trust
No-Headquarters/BOZEMAN, Mont.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), the AI Data Cloud company, today
announced innovations that make it easier for organizations to ingest, access, and govern their data across the entire data lifecycle,
redefining the enterprise lakehouse for the AI era. New advancements to Snowflake Horizon Catalog and Snowflake Openflow
(now generally available) enable enterprises to connect all of their data from disparate sources and catalogs, making it accessible for
AI agents to drive value — all with consistent, built-in security and governance. Snowflake is also redefining how enterprises can
build and power AI agents and apps by helping organizations turn data into immediate insights and near real-time experiences with
Interactive Tables and Warehouses (generally available soon), as well as enabling customers to leverage real-time transactional data
faster and more efficiently with Snowflake Postgres (public preview soon).
“The enterprise lakehouse represents the evolution of how
organizations manage and activate data for AI,” said Christian
Kleinerman, EVP of Product, Snowflake. “With advancements
to Horizon Catalog, we’re giving enterprises context and
governance for AI across all their data by default — wherever it
lives, and without vendor lock-in. Coupled with Openflow and
Snowflake Postgres, it’s now even easier for customers to
Skip to main content
connect and use their data securely, turning every dataset into
the fuel for intelligence.” REQUEST A MEETING WITH MANAGEMENT
New advancements to Snowflake Horizon Catalog offer thousands of “In the marketing industry, data is everything — and at Merkle,
customers and partners, including Merkle and RelationalAI, the universal AI protecting that data and our customers’ privacy is paramount,”
catalog that provides context and governance for AI across all data
said Peter Rogers, EVP, Head of Data and Technology,
Americas, Merkle. “With Snowflake’s Horizon Catalog, built
from the ground up with security and governance at its core, we can ensure customer data, including sensitive identity information,
is handled responsibly while safeguarding customer trust.”
Expanding Interoperability Across the Enterprise Lakehouse
Organizations struggle with AI readiness due to fragmented governance and siloed data systems. In fact, a recent study found that
80% of IT leaders point to data silos as the primary obstacle to building successful AI strategies1. Horizon Catalog addresses these
challenges by providing context for AI and a unified security and governance framework that secures and connects data across
every region, cloud, and format — all interoperable and without vendor lock-in. It’s designed to work seamlessly with any engine,
any data format, and from anywhere — spanning native Snowflake objects, open table formats like Apache Iceberg™2 and Delta
Lake, and even data stored in relational databases such as SQL Server and Postgres.
By bringing open APIs from Apache Polaris™ (Incubating)3 and Apache Iceberg™ REST Catalog4 directly into Horizon Catalog,
Snowflake now provides customers with the de facto enterprise lakehouse — centralizing governance, security, and interoperable
access management across their data in open table formats. These advancements enable external engines to securely access data
(public preview soon) in Apache Iceberg tables, as well as create, update, or manage data stored in Iceberg tables (private preview
soon). Organizations now gain advanced flexibility, allowing teams to securely use their preferred engines on a single copy of data,
making it easier to share, connect, and activate that data from a universal AI catalog. Snowflake’s latest integration offers customers
and partners like Merkle and RelationalAI the freedom to confidently use the best engines and tools for their specific business
needs across a single point of governance. Snowflake is also enhancing data resilience with Business Continuity and Disaster
Recovery (now in public preview) for managed Iceberg tables, further safeguarding enterprises’ critical data across the entire
enterprise lakehouse.
With Openflow, enterprise users can securely automate data integration and ingestion from virtually any source, making it easier to
keep data centralized across the enterprise lakehouse. Hundreds of customers including Brightfire, EVgo, and Intelitics already
utilize Openflow to unify their data across various types and formats, so they can rapidly deploy AI-powered innovations. Snowflake
is also expanding integration options through its partnership with Oracle (now in private preview), enabling customers to harness
near real-time change data capture built on Openflow to continuously stream transactional updates into the Snowflake AI Data
Cloud.
Powering Immediate Insights and Near Real-Time Experiences
As AI raises expectations for speed and interactivity, today’s organizations are under pressure to deliver immediate, data-driven
experiences. To meet this growing demand, Snowflake is extending its leadership in data performance across all data with the
introduction of Interactive Tables and Interactive Warehouses. Providing low-latency and high-concurrency, this new advancement
makes analytics feel instantaneous, enabling teams to uncover insights in sub-seconds, not minutes. Now, enterprises have the
power to work with live data immediately across their business intelligence tools, powering fast, intelligent apps and AI agents — all
under Snowflake’s unified and governed platform. Interactive Tables and Warehouses move customers beyond traditional, batch
analytics to deliver truly interactive experiences, without the burden of managing complex infrastructure overhead.
Building on this foundation, Snowflake is introducing near real-time streaming analytics (now in private preview), enabling
organizations to act on live data within seconds, using the familiar tools and secure platform they already trust. With built-in
support for leading data streams like Kafka, Kinesis, and other sources, customers can now combine live data with historical context
to power mission-critical use cases like fraud detection, personalization, recommendations, observability, and IoT monitoring.
Whether modernizing existing analytics or launching new near real-time services, Snowflake customers now gain an end-to-end
solution for immediate insights and streaming intelligence across all their data.

Delivering Enterprise-Grade Capabilities that Fuel AI Agents and Apps

 REQUEST A MEETING WITH MANAGEMENT
Following Snowflake’s recent acquisition of Crunchy Data, the company has introduced Snowflake Postgres, a fully-managed
service that brings the world’s most popular database onto the Snowflake platform. The separation of transactional data in Postgres
from analytical data has long been a major architectural roadblock for enterprises, forcing costly data movement and preventing
real-time data access for apps and AI agents. Snowflake Postgres changes this by extending support to transactional, hybrid, and
analytical workloads natively on the Snowflake platform. Now, Snowflake is bringing the Postgres database and ecosystem
developers love to the platform enterprises trust. With transactional Postgres data within the same secure foundation as
enterprises’ analytics and AI, Snowflake is progressing the enterprise lakehouse beyond insight into action — helping organizations
build AI agents and intelligent apps on operational data.
Snowflake is also open sourcing pg_lake (now generally available), a set of Postgres extensions designed to help developers and
data engineers integrate Postgres with a powerful lakehouse system. With pg_lake, developers can directly query, manage, and
write to Apache Iceberg tables using standard SQL — all from their familiar Postgres environment.
Building on these innovations, Snowflake is continuing to bring transactional and analytical workloads together through major
advancements in Snowflake Unistore, powered by Hybrid Tables. Now generally available on Microsoft Azure, Hybrid Tables
empower organizations to simplify their data management and build lightweight transactional apps on Snowflake. And to ensure
these workloads meet the stringent security needs of modern enterprises, Snowflake is introducing enhanced security capabilities
for Hybrid Tables — including Tri-Secret Secure support (now generally available), an extra layer of protection with a customer-
managed key, and periodic rekeying (now generally available) to strengthen data protection and help organizations meet regulatory
requirements.

No-Headquarters/BOZEMAN, Mont.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), the AI Data Cloud company, today
announced a partnership as the Official Data Cloud Provider for the USA Bobsled/Skeleton (USABS) team. This partnership will link
a world-class data and AI platform with an elite team dedicated to building upon its legacy of Olympic medals. With Snowflake,
USABS gains a crucial competitive advantage as the team heads toward the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games Milano Cortina
2026.
“Grit, resilience, and excellence are the hallmarks of our
athletes, and we see those same values in Snowflake’s DNA,”
said Curt Tomasevicz, U.S. Olympic gold medalist (Bobsled) and
Director of Sport Performance for USABS. “We are thrilled to
join forces with Snowflake because they understand that the
path to excellence is paved with data intelligence. By unifying

Turning Data Intelligence Into On-Track Performance
USABS will leverage the leading data and AI capabilities of Snowflake’s AI Data Cloud to drive its performance strategy to support
athletes, optimize sled technology and enhance strategic decision-making on the track. In addition, USABS will be able to harness
real-time data and AI for sophisticated data analytics aimed at improving every aspect of sled performance and athlete technique.
With Snowflake Intelligence (currently public preview, general availability coming soon), an enterprise intelligence agent that
provides every user with the ability to answer complex questions in natural language, USABS will be able to:
Optimize Push Combinations: Analyze the synchronized performance of two- and four-person crews to determine more
efficient pairings and load techniques.
Deconstruct the Start: Isolate and correct performance inefficiencies—such as the problematic ""bump"" during the jump-in
phase—by correlating small velocity disturbances with precise X,Y,Z acceleration data.
Drive Medal-Winning Insights: Provide coaches with fast, actionable data analysis to make micro-adjustments to athlete
training and technique that can shave critical hundredths of a second off run times.
“At Snowflake, we understand that speed and precision are critical, whether you're deriving insights from petabytes of data or
navigating an icy track at 90 miles per hour,” said Denise Persson, Chief Marketing Officer at Snowflake. “Snowflake Intelligence is
the Ice Meister for an organization's data. Just as no pilot can win on a flawed track, no team can gain a competitive edge without a
flawless data foundation. We’re proud to partner with USABS to help them optimize every element of their preparation and
strategy with our cutting-edge technology.”
Earlier this year, Snowflake announced a three-year partnership as the Official Data Collaboration Provider for Team USA and the
LA28 Games to deliver the most data-driven Games of all time. This partnership with USABS builds on Snowflake’s commitment to

A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP guidance measures is not available on a forward-looking
basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, expenses that may be incurred
in the future. Stock-based compensation-related charges, including employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock
transactions, are impacted by the timing of employee stock transactions, the future fair market value of our common stock, and our
future hiring and retention needs, all of which are difficult to predict and subject to constant change. These factors could be
material to our results computed in accordance with GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial
measures in the financial statement tables for our historical non-GAAP financial results included in this release. Our fiscal year ends
January 31, and numbers are rounded for presentation purposes.

Statement Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We report the following non-GAAP financial measures, which have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures
calculated in accordance with GAAP. Skip to main content

Non-GAAP Product gross profit, Operating income, Net income, Net income attributable RtoEQ SUnEoSTw Afl MaEkEeT IINnGc .W, IaTnHd M NANeAtG iEnMcEoNmTe
per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders—basic and diluted.Non-GAAP product gross profit, operating
income, net income, and net income attributable to Snowflake Inc. are each defined as the respective GAAP measure,
excluding, as applicable, the effect of (i) stock-based compensation-related charges, including employer payroll tax-related
items on employee stock transactions, (ii) amortization of acquired intangibles, (iii) expenses associated with acquisitions and
strategic investments, (iv) amortization of debt issuance costs, (v) restructuring charges, (vi) asset impairment related to office
facility exit, (vii) adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interest, and (viii) the related income tax effect of these
adjustments as well as the non-recurring income tax expense or benefit associated with acquisitions. Non-GAAP product
gross margin is calculated as non-GAAP product gross profit as a percentage of product revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin
is calculated as non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue. Our non-GAAP net income per share attributable to
Snowflake Inc. common stockholders—basic is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income attributable to Snowflake Inc. by
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Our non-GAAP net income per
share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders—diluted is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income
attributable to Snowflake Inc. by the non-GAAP weighted-average number of diluted shares outstanding, which includes (a)
the effect of all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents (stock options, restricted stock units, employee stock purchase
rights under our 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan), (b) the potential dilutive effect of the shares issuable upon conversion
of the Notes using the if-converted method, and (c) the antidilutive impact, if any, of the Capped Calls entered into in
connection with the Notes. The Capped Calls are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any
conversion of the Notes under certain circumstances. Under GAAP, the antidilutive impact of the Capped Calls is not reflected
in diluted shares outstanding until exercised. For the historical periods presented, there was no material antidilutive impact of
the Capped Calls. The potential dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units with performance conditions not yet
satisfied is included in the non-GAAP weighted-average number of diluted shares at forecasted attainment levels to the
extent we believe it is probable that the performance conditions will be met. Amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest
were not material for all periods presented. We believe the presentation of operating results that exclude these items that are
(i) non-cash items, (ii) non-recurring items, or (iii) items that have highly variable amounts due to factors beyond our control
and are unrelated to our core operations such that management does not consider them in evaluating the business
performance or making operating plans, provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of
our operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods.
Free cash flow. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and
equipment and capitalized internal-use software development costs. Cash outflows for employee payroll tax items related to
the net share settlement of equity awards are included in cash flow for financing activities and, as a result, do not have an
effect on the calculation of free cash flow. Free cash flow margin is calculated as free cash flow as a percentage of revenue.
We believe these measures provide useful supplemental information to investors because they are indicators of the strength
and performance of our core business operations.
Adjusted free cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as free cash flow plus (minus) net cash paid (received) on employer
and employee payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions. Employee payroll tax-related items on employee
stock transactions are generally pass-through transactions that are expected to have a net zero impact on free cash flow over
time, but that may impact free cash flow in any given fiscal quarter due to differences between the time that we receive funds
from our employees and the time we remit those funds to applicable tax authorities. We believe that excluding the effects of
these payroll tax-related items will enhance stockholders' ability to evaluate our free cash flow performance, including on a
quarter-over-quarter basis. Adjusted free cash flow margin is calculated as adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of revenue.
We believe these measures provide useful supplemental information to investors because they are indicators of the strength
and performance of our core business operations.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to
evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute
for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar
measures used by other companies. We encourage investors to carefully consider our results under GAAP, as well as our
supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand our business.
Please see the tables included at the end of this release foSrk tiph eto rmeacion nccoinliteantiton of GAAP to non-GAAP results.

Key Business Metrics
We monitor our key business metrics, including (i) free cash flow and (ii) the other metrics set forth below to help us evaluate our
business and growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational
efficiencies. See the section titled “Statement Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for the definition of free cash flow.
The calculation of our key business metrics may differ from other similarly titled metrics used by other companies, securities
analysts, or investors.
Product Revenue.Product revenue is a key metric for us because we recognize revenue based on platform consumption,
which is inherently variable at our customers’ discretion, and not based on the amount and duration of contract terms.
Product revenue is primarily derived from the consumption of compute, storage, and data transfer resources by customers on
our platform. Customers have the flexibility to consume more than their contracted capacity during the contract term and
may have the ability to roll over unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity at
renewal. Our consumption-based business model distinguishes us from subscription-based software companies that generally
recognize revenue ratably over the contract term and may not permit rollover. Because customers have flexibility in the timing
of their consumption, which can exceed their contracted capacity or extend beyond the original contract term in many cases,
the amount of product revenue recognized in a given period is an important indicator of customer satisfaction and the value
derived from our platform. While customer use of our platform in any period is not necessarily indicative of future use, we
estimate future revenue using predictive models based on customers’ historical usage to plan and determine financial
forecasts. Product revenue excludes our professional services and other revenue.
Net Revenue Retention Rate.To calculate net revenue retention rate, we first specify a measurement period consisting of the
trailing two years from our current period end. Next, we define as our measurement cohort the population of customers
under capacity contracts that used our platform at any point in the first month of the first year of the measurement period.
The cohorts used to calculate net revenue retention rate include end-customers under a reseller arrangement. We then
calculate our net revenue retention rate as the quotient obtained by dividing our product revenue from this cohort in the
second year of the measurement period by our product revenue from this cohort in the first year of the measurement period.
Any customer in the cohort that did not use our platform in the second year remains in the calculation and contributes zero
product revenue in the second year. Our net revenue retention rate is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations,
spin-offs, and other market activity, and we present our net revenue retention rate for historical periods reflecting these
adjustments. Since we will continue to attribute the historical product revenue to the consolidated contract, consolidation of
capacity contracts within a customer’s organization typically will not impact our net revenue retention rate unless one of
those customers was not a customer at any point in the first month of the first year of the measurement period.
Customers with Trailing 12-Month Product Revenue Greater than $1 Million.To calculate the number of customers with
trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million, we count the number of customers under capacity arrangements
that contributed more than $1 million in product revenue in the trailing 12 months. For purposes of determining our customer
count, we treat each customer account, including accounts for end-customers under a reseller arrangement, that has at least
one corresponding capacity contract as a unique customer, and a single organization with multiple divisions, segments, or
subsidiaries may be counted as multiple customers. We do not include customers that consume our platform only under on-
demand arrangements for purposes of determining our customer count. Our customer count is subject to adjustments for
acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity, and we present our customer count for historical periods
reflecting these adjustments.
Forbes Global 2000 Customers. Our Forbes Global 2000 customer count is a subset of our customer count based on the
2024 Forbes Global 2000 list. Our Forbes Global 2000 customer count is subject to adjustments for annual updates to the list
by Forbes, as well as acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity with respect to such customers, and we
present our Forbes Global 2000 customer count for historical periods reflecting these adjustments.
Remaining Performance Obligations.Remaining performance obligations (RPO) represent the amount of contracted future
revenue that has not yet been recognized, including (i) deferred revenue and (ii) non-cancelable contracted amounts that will
be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. RPO excludes performance obligations from on-demand
arrangements and certain time and materials contracStksip t thoa mt aainre c obniltleendt in arrears. Portions of RPO that are not yet invoiced and

are denominated in foreign currencies are revalued into U.S. dollars each period based on the applicable period-end exchange
 REQUEST A MEETING WITH MANAGEMENT
rates. RPO is not necessarily indicative of future product revenue growth because it does not account for the timing of
customers’ consumption or their consumption of more than their contracted capacity. Moreover, RPO is influenced by a
number of factors, including the timing and size of renewals, the timing and size of purchases of additional capacity, average
contract terms, seasonality, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the extent to which customers are permitted to
roll over unused capacity to future periods, generally upon the purchase of additional capacity at renewal. Due to these
factors, it is important to review RPO in conjunction with product revenue and other financial metrics disclosed elsewhere
herein.

financing activities
(1) Restructuring charges relate to certain costs incurred by us during the three and twelve months ended January 31, 2025 in
connection with a restructuring plan for a majority-owned subsidiary.
(2) Stock-based compensation-related charges included employer payroll tax-related expenses on employee stock transactions of
approximately $11.1 million and $51.9 million for the three and twelve months ended January 31, 2025, respectively, and $11.0
million and $45.5 million for the three and twelve months ended January 31, 2024, respectively.
(3) For the periods in which we had non-GAAP net income, the non-GAAP weighted-average shares used in computing non-GAAP
net income per share attributable to Snowflake Inc. common stockholders—diluted included (a) the effect of all potentially dilutive
common stock equivalents (stock options, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase rights under our 2020 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan) and (b) the potential dilutive effect of shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes using the if-converted
method, starting from the issuance date of the Notes. The Capped Calls entered into in connection with the Notes had no material
antidilutive impact for any of the historical periods presented. The potential dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units with
performance conditions not yet satisfied is included in the non-GAAP weighted-average number of diluted shares at forecasted
attainment levels to the extent we believe it is probable that the performance conditions will be met.
(4) The amounts for the three and twelve months ended January 31, 2025 do not include employee payroll taxes of $129.5 million
and $489.1 million, respectively, and the amounts for the three and twelve months ended January 31, 2024 do not include
employee payroll taxes of $107.0 million and $380.8 million, respectively, related to net share settlement of employee restricted
stock units, which were reflected as cash outflows for financing activities.
