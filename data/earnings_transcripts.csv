Good afternoon, and welcome to Teradata's first quarter 2025 earnings call. Steve McMillan, Teradata's President
and Chief Executive Officer, will lead our call today; followed by Sumeet Arora, Teradata's Chief Product Officer;
and then, Charles Smotherman, Teradata's Interim Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our financial results
and outlook.
Our discussion today includes forecast and other information that are considered forward-looking statements.
While these statements reflect our current outlook, they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that
could cause actual results to differ materially. These risk factors are described in today's earnings release and in
our SEC filings.
Please note that Teradata intends to file the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, later this month.
These forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we undertake no duty or obligation to update them.
On today's call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures which exclude such items as stock-
based compensation expense, other special items described in our earnings release. We will also discuss other
non-GAAP items such as free cash flow, constant currency comparisons, and 2025 revenue and ARR growth
outlook in constant currency.
Unless stated otherwise, all numbers and results discussed on today's call are on a non-GAAP basis. A
reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in our earnings release, which is accessible on the
Investor Relations page of our website at investor.teradata.com. A replay of this conference call will be available
later today on our website.
And now, I will turn the call over to Steve.

Thank you, Chad, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Teradata had a solid first quarter of 2025. We
delivered public cloud ARR of $606 million, a 16% year-on-year increase in constant currency. We saw a total
ARR of $1.44 billion, in line with expectations on a constant currency basis. We generated $7 million in free cash
flow in the quarter and our non-GAAP EPS was $0.66, an increase of 16% year-on-year.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 06-May-2025
In Q1, we maintained our focus on execution and are seeing benefits from the actions that began in the middle of
last year. Our go-to-market team is executing well against the pipeline we carried into 2025. We are seeing
positive effects from the team's increasing focus on advanced analytics and industry use cases, both in cloud and
on prem.
Cloud is now 42% of our total ARR, and we are also seeing that our hybrid capabilities are very relevant in times
of macro volatility. We are meeting customers in the environment that best addresses their needs now and into
the future, and believe that our cloud and hybrid capabilities will resonate in the market.
Many of our customers rely on insights from the Teradata environments to help them operate their businesses
efficiently, even in times of uncertainty. We are monitoring the dynamic market and are working closely with
customers to help them get the most out of their data and analytics as they address the uncertain climate. We've
assessed the direct impact from the dynamic tariff situation, and it is expected to be immaterial to our business in
2025. As we look ahead, we are taking a more prudent stance with respect to our services business, which is
more subject to discretionary spending.
As the world explores use cases of AI, it is imperative that the data behind the AI is secure, appropriately
governed, and trusted. Trusted data is critical to success with AI, and agentic or autonomous AI depends on
massive amounts of trusted data across both structured and unstructured sources. This integration of diverse
data types at any scale is Teradata's core strength.
To succeed with agentic AI, you need not just trusted data, but high-performance vector processing capabilities
that can deliver the right information in the moment, so that agents can take action in real time, whether someone
is in a chat session, on the website, or on the phone. These actions will increasingly be performed by AI agents
that will need to seamlessly access both structured and unstructured data to derive the best answer for
customers.
In early March, we announced Teradata Enterprise Vector Store. This in-database solution brings the speed,
power, and multidimensional scale of our hybrid analytics platform to vector data and management, a crucial
infrastructure component for building trusted, effective AI systems. It is designed to help customers move beyond
basic generative AI implementations toward sophisticated agentic AI and autonomous business processes.
Our Enterprise Vector Store, which will integrate with NVIDIA's NeMo Retriever microservices, can enable
enterprises to solve multidimensional complex problems by combining structured and unstructured data with
accelerated compute to optimize RAG applications, which we believe will create a single source of truth for all of a
company's AI initiatives. We are enthusiastic about the interest we are seeing, and I'll talk about some of the
examples of use cases we are working on with our customers.
This quarter, we plan to introduce innovations designed for enterprises that need more control and flexibility over
their AI deployments, particularly in today's dynamic and often uncertain environment. Many of our customers
operate in regulated industries with strict requirements for data sovereignty and security, and we believe that our
forthcoming AI on-prem capabilities will be uniquely positioned to enable independent and secure AI operations
without compromising EDW service levels, a critical differentiator in today's hybrid cloud landscape.
We are continuing to build and execute robust partnerships that position us well in the open ecosystems we see
customers increasingly adopting. In the quarter, our teams were collaborating at customer engagements with
AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, NVIDIA and more. I'll cover a few examples of how our teams are helping
customers trial and implement their strategies for AI with our foundation of managing trusted data.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 06-May-2025
A global telco's fraud prevention team leveraged our ClearScape Analytics and machine learning to detect
targeted fraud and is achieving a 50% increase in fraud detection accuracy. Their model enhances explainability,
enabling analysts to make informed decisions with 95% accuracy while reducing manual effort.
A large customer in Asia-Pac is evolving its responsible gambling models with help from us. Using our ModelOps,
the customer monitors and manages its machine learning models. They use ClearScape Analytics for native
analytical models, as well as the bring-your-own-model capability for machine learning models. Their most
advanced models are deployed and scored in Teradata VantageCloud, enabling scalability and lowering costs.
We supported a major European airline in elevating analysis of customer feedback. Leveraging our vector store
and a Hugging Face model, we helped the customer analyze text messages to detect trends and sentiments. This
integrated approach is designed to help the customer ensure data protection, enhance performance, and deliver
reliable results.
We also helped a large grocery retailer demonstrate significant business value by categorizing customer
complaints using vector embeddings and bring-your-own-language-model functionality. The customer was
impressed with the gen AI integration capabilities of our platform, which streamlined the classification and
response process for text-based complaints, thereby enhancing service quality and efficiency. A key aspect was
the high-performance processing at scale of our differentiated massive parallel processing capability.
Also, a top five US health care company significantly expanded its Teradata environment as it migrated to the
cloud and works to enhance resilience against cyber threats and ensure continuity in health care services. It is
also implementing a gen AI solution with us to automate large amounts of audit processes and significantly
improve productivity, making the health care system work better for everyone.
These customer examples are supported with industry reports as well. Teradata was recently named a leader in
the Forrester Wave on Data Management for Analytics Platforms. We were pleased to receive this recognition of
the strength of our strategic vision and performance in delivering AI-powered, enterprise-grade analytics at scale.
We believe this report reflects our strong analytic platform capabilities, particularly for hybrid cloud deployments
where reliability and scalability are essential.
With our solid performance in Q1, our ongoing focus on execution and accelerating innovation that brings trusted
AI to our customers, we continue to believe that we will return to growth in 2025. We believe that our differentiated
ability to support customers' data and analytics needs, whether in the cloud, on-prem or hybrid environments,
serves us well during these times of uncertainty.
As I hand over to Charles, I want to provide an update on our most recent executive appointments. Yesterday, we
announced our new CFO, John Ederer, who will be starting with us next week. John is currently the CFO at Model
N, a provider of revenue management solutions for Life Sciences and High Tech. He's a seasoned financial
executive and has successfully led a number of companies through SaaS transitions. I'm looking forward to
working with John.
I also want to thank Charles for serving as Interim CFO during this quarter of transition. I am also pleased to
introduce to you today our new Chief Product Officer, Sumeet Arora, who just joined us. Most recently, Sumeet
was the Chief Development Officer at ThoughtSpot. Sumeet has extensive experience in leading, engineering
and product management for AI-driven analytics and a proven track record in building solutions that generate
significant revenue.

I've asked Sumeet to make a few comments on the opportunity he sees as he joins Teradata. Sumeet, over to
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sumeet Arora
Chief Product Officer, Teradata Corp.
Thank you, Steve. I'm thrilled to be part of the Teradata team. I see that Teradata has unique strengths. First, its
customer base is something that any business would strive to have. The top banks, airlines, telecommunication
companies, health care providers, and retailers use Teradata every day to deliver business outcomes and data-
driven experiences. There is a lot of valuable data managed within Teradata environments.
Second, I see Teradata as the only platform that can work with data as it exists in most large enterprises. Data is
not all clean and located in one system. Rather, it spans on-prem and multi-cloud environments for both historical
as well as price-performance reasons. I believe that Teradata has a unique advantage with its hybrid cloud
platform.
And third, just like the cloud leveled the playing field a decade ago, AI is leveling the playing field again. There is
no trusted AI without trusted data. The Teradata platform is evolving to enable AI workloads that leverage
enterprise data to deliver autonomous business processes. For example, Teradata Enterprise Vector Store is an
enterprise scale and enterprise grade vector store purpose-built for agentic workloads and RAG-based
implementations. I believe that our ability to work with data across on-prem and cloud environments and deliver AI
across all of this data is a competitive and price-performance advantage.
Together with the team, my goal is to greatly accelerate Teradata's innovation execution. We expect to do this in
close partnership with our customers as we evolve from here. Working with data across hybrid environments and
by delivering trusted AI capabilities, our goal will be to help our customers deploy autonomous business
workflows that in turn improve the experience of their end customers. I believe that Teradata is well-positioned to
be the business outcomes platform for the data and AI-powered enterprise.
I will bring my experience in the technology industry, driving efficient and high-velocity innovation to help Teradata
accelerate. Before joining Teradata, I led product, engineering and design at ThoughtSpot, a data analytics
company and an industry pioneer in building AI-powered natural language analytics targeted at the business user.
During my time, ThoughtSpot transitioned the application to a full platform that is now replacing established
incumbents and was fast to market with an agentic AI analyst solution, thereby becoming one of the earliest in-
production AI-native analytics platform in the industry.
Prior to ThoughtSpot, I was at Cisco, and at both companies, I focused on building great products, great teams,
as well as great businesses with a focus on execution. I look forward to helping Teradata execute and accelerate.
Now, I will pass the call to Charles.

Charles Smotherman
Interim Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Thank you, Sumeet, and good afternoon, everyone. In the first quarter, we executed in line with expectations
across our key metrics: total ARR, cloud ARR, free cash flow, and non-GAAP EPS. As we expected in the first
quarter, we had a decline in total ARR sequentially due to the first quarter being seasonally our lowest bookings
and highest erosion quarter of the year. Total ARR declined 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis,

which was a 2-point improvement from the end of 2024. We continue to see year-over-year increase in retention
rates as our customer success team drives improvements in customer health metrics across our base.
Additionally, we expect meaningful year-over-year improvement in retention rates for the remainder of the year.
Cloud ARR grew 16% year-over-year in constant currency, representing the midpoint of our 2025 outlook range.
Cloud net expansion rate was 115%, which continues to be impacted by lower expansion activity last year. Based
on our increased visibility, we continue to believe that we will return to total ARR growth in Q4. We are reiterating
our outlook for total ARR of flat to 2% and cloud ARR growth of 14% to 18% year-over-year.
Let me now share more details on our quarterly financial results, starting with revenue. First quarter recurring
revenue was $358 million, down 8% year-over-year as reported and down 6% year-over-year in constant
currency. The year-over-year growth rate was negatively impacted by 1 point from upfront revenue. Recurring
revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 86%, up from 83% in the prior-year period.
First quarter total revenue was $418 million, down 10% year-over-year as reported and 8% in constant currency,
which was towards the low end of our expectations. In light of the overall macroeconomic uncertainty, we're
expanding the low-end of our total revenue outlook range by 1 percentage point due to the more discretionary
nature of our services business.
Moving to profitability and free cash flow, total gross margin for the quarter was 60.3%, down 190 basis points
year-over-year, primarily due to services. Our services business continues to be impacted by lower bookings in
the second half of 2024. We are optimizing our cost structure to enable us to return to a positive services margin
in the second half of the year.
Operating margin was 21.8%, up 270 basis points year-over-year. The operating margin expansion is largely due
to the restructuring actions taken last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.66, exceeding the top-
end of our outlook range. The outperformance is primarily from lower spend and FX.
We generated $7 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which was slightly ahead of our expectations due to
accelerated collections that were due in Q2. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $44 million of
stock or 1.6 million shares, and we continue to expect to return at least 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders
in the form of share repurchases.
With regards to the 2025 outlook, we reaffirm total ARR, cloud ARR, free cash flow, recurring revenue and non-
GAAP EPS. For total revenue, we are expanding the range to reflect negative 4% to negative 7% year-over-year
on a constant currency basis.
On total ARR and cloud ARR, we continue to see the same linearity as we mentioned last quarter. In the first half,
we expect the growth rate of total ARR to be below our outlook range and cloud ARR to be at the low-end of our
range. We expect both growth rates to accelerate in the second half and return to total ARR growth in the fourth
quarter.
Please refer to our Q1 earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website for a complete list of our 2025
outlook ranges.
For the second quarter of 2025, we anticipate recurring revenue to be in the range of negative 5% to negative 7%
year-over-year on a constant currency basis. In Q2, we anticipate a 2% headwind driven by upfront recurring
revenue. We expect total revenue to be in the range of negative 7% to negative 9% year-over-year on a constant

currency basis. We anticipate marginal negative currency impact year-over-year using the end of March rates. We
anticipate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.41. We project the non-GAAP
tax rate to be approximately 23.1% and weighted average shares outstanding to be 97 million.
We had a solid start to the year. While we recognize the volatility around the current macroeconomic
environment, our pragmatic approach to our 2025 outlook remains intact. The organizational changes we began
last year are starting to take hold, driving meaningful improvement in retention rates, more consistent execution,
and our focus on AI innovation. We remain committed to returning to total ARR growth in Q4, producing strong
operating margin and free cash flow and returning capital to shareholders.
Thank you all for your time today. Now, let's open the call for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik W. Woodring Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks so much, guys. Good afternoon. Steve, I just wanted to maybe take a step back. Obviously, you
guys have talked about cost efficiency programs. I'm wondering what the opportunity is to cut additional costs in
this business. And really what I'm getting at is, the new logo engine is a relatively small part of the business, but
you spend nearly twice as much on SG&A as you do on R&D.
You have a very large and very actually well-renowned existing customer base. Can you kind of attack that base
and power your new logo engine with lower levels of total absolute OpEx spend? Because ultimately, what I'm
trying to get at is ways other than growing your business that you could drive free cash flow higher. So, that's just
my first question and then I have a quick follow-up. Thanks so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Hey, Erik. Thanks for the question. Great to hear from you. Taking a step back, as you suggested, we are
absolutely focused on profitable growth and we make the right investments in our organization across all the lines,
our SG&A lines, our research and development, to ensure that we optimize and grow the business overall.
We are returning the business to growth from an ARR perspective in 2025. I think that will set a positive trajectory
for the company as we move forward. We did a lot of restructuring in our sales team in June of last year and
refocused that team in terms of pivoting towards much more analytic, AI, and use case based solutions in the
marketplace. And we are starting to see those having traction in terms of the execution. We're clearly going to
continue to optimize our investment envelope as we move forward, as we drive that profitable growth strategy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik W. Woodring Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you, Steve. And then just quick follow-up was just on the 2Q EPS guide. We're
looking at a pretty significant sequential decline. Can you just maybe help us understand or better understand
some of the moving pieces as to why we're getting there? Obviously, a very strong first quarter. Did you pull

forward profitability, so to speak? Or just help us understand why the shape of the curve in the first half looks the
way it does on the EPS line. Thanks so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles Smotherman A
Interim Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. Thanks for the question. So, want to make sure – you're talking about the $0.66 to the $0.40, correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik W. Woodring Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles Smotherman A
Interim Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Okay. Yeah. So we've got a couple of factors that are playing into this, lower volume being one, lower corporate
spend. We've got higher cloud mix impacting our second quarter as well as lower CFC. That's offset partially by
lower head count and other corporate spend activities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik W. Woodring Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right. Thanks so much, guys. Good luck.

Yitchuin Wong Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hi. Thanks for taking the question here. Congrats on Sumeet's hiring and John from yesterday. It's been a while
since we have the full team again. So, I remember the excitement three, four years ago when you had, like, Claire
and Todd rounded up the team. I guess, back then there was a lot of excitement as well.
Just in the three, four years, looking back in the executive management team, can you tell me, like, what are
some of the biggest lessons learned going into this year and next year with Sumeet and John in pool now? And
what would you be doing differently just given some of the execution issue in the past year? Would like to start
there, please. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. Thanks for the question. Look, I think we are entering into a new phase for Teradata at Teradata 3.0, if you
like. As I reflect back on the last four years, we've been going on a terrific journey to transition and reinvent the
company. And that started off with Teradata 1.0, which was very much about pivoting the company towards cloud.
And in the Teradata 2.0 phase, we doubled down on that growth, clearly taking the company to over $600 million
in cloud ARR. And at the same time, developing innovations in both our analytics capabilities, AI capabilities and
ML capabilities, putting them in database to enable organizations to operate at tremendous scale in this new
world of advanced analytics and AI.
Now, I think we're entering into the next phase which is Teradata 3.0, where our customers are demanding from
us a whole set of business outcomes that are driven and derived from the use of advanced analytics, AI, and ML

solutions. And we have regeared and re-tooled the entire company to start to address those opportunities in the
marketplace. You can see from our new innovation announcements like our Enterprise Vector Store, where we
believe that Teradata has a truly differentiated capability that now will enable us to drive at new TAM for Teradata
in terms of analytics and taking advantage of the AI opportunity in the marketplace.
So, it has been a year – it has been a continuous time of transition and transformation for the company, and we
believe that we're well placed. And I think Sumeet coming onboard is a testimony to that as he looks to drive that
innovation engine forward into the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Yitchuin Wong Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Yeah. Looking forward to see that play out. I guess, the other one on the product, you mentioned the hybrid is
definitely picking up steam. Longer term, how do you view the impact to the cloud? And then, what could we see
kind of longer-term trajectory? Do you expect to see the subscription line and the cloud line? How would that
trajectory kind of [ph] keep us out (00:28:26) going into next year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. Thank you. And again, we're going to return the company to ARR growth to that total level in 2025 as
powered by the real interest that we see. I talk to customers every single day, some of the largest organizations in
the world, and they really like our hybrid platform. And they like to be able to observe data gravity. They like being
met from a technology perspective where they would like to engage. So, that's either in the cloud or from an on-
prem perspective.
We're also seeing real interest in AI on-prem solutions, and we've got a new capability coming out in third quarter
to address that market space. As we look forward, we continue to see good growth in our cloud business. The
midpoint of growth for our cloud business for this year is 16 points. So, good growth in cloud and we see that
hybrid opportunity continues to be a good opportunity for us to execute against.

Operator: Our next question is from Howard Ma with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Howard Ma Q
Analyst, Guggenheim Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question. One for Steve. When we – Steve, so when we think back to the period of
cloud optimizations in the back half of calendar 2022 and throughout 2023, I think most would agree that Teradata
benefited from more customers expanding on prem and then subsequently, you just referred to that period as the
2.0 phase. As your VantageCloud product matured, you saw pretty nice expansions on that.
The question is, given the current macro uncertainty, are there any parallels that you can draw compared to that
period in time? And what are your customers indicating to you in terms of their intentions to expand, things like
you guys mentioned the new Vector Store capability. Are those things giving you more visibility into expansions,
whether it's on prem or in the cloud, than perhaps in the past or maybe not necessarily?

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 06-May-2025
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Howard. I mean, clearly, it's a very dynamic environment out there. But at our
core, from a technology perspective, we have line of sight into the guidance that we have actually both from a
total ARR perspective, but also from a cloud ARR perspective. What we're seeing is our customers, because just
like back in the cloud optimization days, to your point, I used to say that the Teradata platform optimizes itself
every millisecond, which makes us very sticky inside our customers as we deliver the most critical workloads in
the world at tremendous enterprise scale.
The demand for that type of technology is continuing inside our customer base. And we're using that to leverage
and drive growth opportunities in terms of managing that data for our organizations and putting it into new
analytical use cases, which our customers need to respond to these dynamic environments that they're in.
As team pointed out, we did experience some macro impact from a discretionary spend perspective in our
consulting and services business. Our consulting and services business for us is very much a tailwind in terms of
how we do services against technology deals that we've done in the past.
As we look forward, as we start to increase our contribution from our total ARR perspective and our technology
business starts to regain into growth territory, we expect our consulting and services business to reaccelerate into
the back half of the year. So, despite there being macro uncertainty, we've got key line of sight into our results for
FY 2025 and are looking forward to executing against that.

Got it. Thank you, Steve. And on the back of your response, I have a follow-up for Charles, and it's just around the
retention rates. And if you could put some numbers around the improvement, whether they've been up year-over-
year or sequentially? And if the idea, the prepared remarks that you gave, imply that retention rates should
improve sequentially throughout this year, [ph] whether (00:32:51) the balance of this year? Thank you.

Yes. Thanks for the question. Yeah, our viewpoint has not changed from our earlier guide this year and we've
actually seen improvement in 2025. If we look at how we performed in the second half of 2024, that also was
improving. And our customer success team has done a phenomenal job improving those rates and we see
continued improvement for the balance of the year.

Chirag Ved Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Steve, I was just wondering whether you could talk through some of the main
points that give you confidence in maintaining the total ARR and public cloud ARR guide, and the acceleration in
the back half of the year, just given more positive commentary across the board by many other peers in software.
Thank you.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 06-May-2025
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Chirag. Overall, not much has changed from our internal expectations from a
linearity perspective from the beginning of the year to now. We're still seeing good growth in terms of the drivers
that we're expecting. We have factored into our outlook space migrations, the uncertainty that we saw in the
environment.
And when we set guidance at the start of the year, we set a very pragmatic guidance in terms of the overall
outlook for the year. As I said previously, we do have line of insight into that execution for the year, both from a
total ARR perspective and a cloud ARR perspective. And as we said earlier in the year, we've actually taken out
some of the very large deals, the eight-figure deals in terms of our cloud ARR outlook and the execution profile
from that. So, we believe that the guidance that we've issued is solid in terms of the outlook for the full year.

Chirag Ved Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
All right. Thank you so much.

Operator: We have a question from Matthew Hedberg with RBC. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Richards Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, guys. This is Mike Richards on for Matt. Maybe just piggybacking off that question there. Said differently, we
came in the year with a pragmatic guidance and seem conservative. Ex this new macro uncertainty that unfolded
in the past 90 days with Liberation Day, would it be unreasonable to think that guidance could have been raised
on this print? And so, like, we should look at the maintained guide as a conservative approach, just given how you
set it up coming into the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. I think we've issued, as I said, pragmatic guidance for the year. In this environment, we don't want to get
over our skis clearly, yeah? We've issued guidance which we are confident that we have line of sight to execution
with. And we've already seen those patterns in terms of execution. We've seen our new TTM team that we put in
place in June of last year start to execute consistently against the opportunity pipeline that's in front of them.
We've seen that meaningful improvement in our retention rates through the back half of last year, and that
continued into first quarter. And we have line of sight and that's continuing to improve into second quarter and the
second half of the year. So, that gives us the confidence in terms of holding the gates to where we are and
delivering on the promise that we made at the start of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Richards Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Thanks. And then, just a quick follow-up. Could you remind us of your Fed exposure? And then, any trends
you've seen there over the past quarter, specifically pertaining to DOGE? And any either buying ahead or pausing
you might see in that vertical? Thanks, again, guys.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 06-May-2025
Charles Smotherman A
Interim Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. Thanks for the question. We have a healthy government business globally, but the majority of that business
is international, state and local, and very minimal exposure from the federal spend at this point.

Operator: Our next question is from Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Jungjohann Q
Analyst, TD Cowen
Hi, team. This is Jared Jungjohann on for Derrick Wood. On the prior go-to-market changes, last quarter you
noted reps have settled into the new segment team. Now that we're another quarter down the road, can you just
give us an update on some of the benefits you're seeing? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah, for sure. I think what we're seeing is a real pivot towards analytics, AI and use case business. If I look at the
pipeline that the sales team are now generating, there's a lot of interest in terms of using those AI capabilities and
using the Teradata platform and an AI ecosystem. So, we're super excited about the POCs that we've been doing
with our customers. They start small, they drive usage of the existing platform. And then, where we come into our
own is actually helping customers drive that workload – those workloads into production.
And indeed, we've taken some cloud-native solutions that our customers have been deploying. And although we
did the development and the testing of those solutions and other cloud-native environments, they actually
deployed the model themselves in the Teradata environment. And in some cases, that's at over twice the speed
and often towards half the cost in terms of execution.
And so, those are the kind of improvements in our go-to-market model, taking those kinds of messages to our
customers. And we believe it makes Teradata relevant and helps us drive growth into the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Jungjohann Q
Analyst, TD Cowen
That's awesome. Good to hear. And then, as a follow-up on that, how should we be thinking about the impact
from these AI-related products on revenue this year? I understand it's early and presumably would be pretty
small, but any color on that would be great. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah, it's certainly early, but an exciting space for us. We certainly see a good pipeline growing and interest in
energy growing. Again, I think we have a very, very sticky business in, say, Teradata, which insulates us from the
many impacts of the macro economy environment because of the fixed capacity nature of our contracts.
As our customers utilize these AI use cases, it drives the usage of the Teradata platform and ultimately will
require our customers to increase the capacity. So, the revenue impact from these new capabilities are likely
pushed out into next year. And that combined with returning to overall ARR growth in 2025 sets a bright future
growth for us as we execute over the next couple of years.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 06-May-2025
Operator: We have a question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Wamsi Mohan Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Thank you. I just wanted to get back to the full-year guidance. You noted no meaningful direct impact from
tariffs, but you clearly have large customers in retail, for example, and there seems to be a lot of uncertainty
around a vertical like that where tariffs are having meaningful impact.
Could you just help us think through why maybe that doesn't slow down the path of increased uncertainty where
maybe the customers have to do some belt tightening? Is there enough slack across other verticals maybe where
you're seeing increased activity? Could you just share some color around maybe different verticals and what
you're seeing today and what – how you'd expect that full year to progress? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Hi, Wamsi. Thank you very much for the questions. Yeah, I think that just goes back to the very sticky nature of
Teradata. The fact that we work with the biggest organizations in the world and execute their most critical
business processes, they literally run their business on Teradata. And therefore, it's very difficult to turn off that
Teradata environment if you still want to close your books.
As you know, we're not highly dependent on our consumption model for our revenues. Much of our revenue is
generated from fixed capacity ARR contracts. And therefore, that gives us really great line of sight into how those
contracts are going to grow into the next quarters of the year.
I think what we are seeing is working with organizations to help them understand that dynamic environment,
working with them in the customer experience use cases, helping them forward forecast on demand planning to
have the right responses in this dynamic environment, also helping them from a supply chain perspective so that
they can ultimately manage their supply chain.
And they need the data that are in the Teradata systems to actually make these decisions to optimize their
operations every day. So, from a data perspective, we have real line of sight into the guidance that we've given.
And from a macro perspective, in terms of our technology sales, we're confident in the guidance that we've
provided.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Wamsi Mohan Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Steve. And if I could just follow up, can you just give us any update, if there is one, around what
you're seeing from some of your boomerang customers? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. I mentioned a couple of use cases in the prepared remarks, where we certainly work with customers in
areas and environments which would traditionally go to our competitors, especially in the analytics space and the
AI space.
What I would say as well is that we're definitely seeing customers interested in the new Teradata capabilities, both
from an on-prem perspective, so looking to consolidate their on-prem technologies, but also from a cloud

perspective, we're seeing customers who want to optimize their cloud spend and are realizing that running some
of these cloud data solutions at enterprise scale can be prohibitively expensive. And they are utilizing Teradata to
controls their costs as they look at the types of platforms that they want to run and deploy on.
And then, overall, I think our hybrid capability is highly differentiated with more than 60% of the customers that we
have in the cloud also working with us from an on-prem perspective. We see that hybrid platform being very
interesting for our customers and makes it even more sticky as we're one of the few providers that can have that
capability.

Operator: Our next question is from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sheldon McMeans Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi. This is Sheldon McMeans on for Raimo. Thanks for taking our question. First for Steve, we were at the
ServiceNow Analyst Day this week, and it was interesting to see you and some of the other leaders in the data
analytics space up on the big screen talking about your role in AI agent space. So, you talked – you mentioned a
little bit on the call, but would love to hear from your perspective, how do you see the role of data warehouses,
data lake providers like yourself in that ecosystem?
And then – and as we think about maybe this is a little bit of a shift to more on the transactional side or on the
operational side as opposed to analytical. And so, would love to hear your thoughts on how that will play out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we're delighted with the partnership with ServiceNow and being featured
with them at their most recent Knowledge Conference. I think it really points out being part of ServiceNow's data
network is a really exciting opportunity for us. And it really plays testimony to how we have evolved our platform
over the last three or four years, so we can utilize structured and unstructured data and then we can operate and
utilize data at tremendous scale inside our customer environment to provide real-time insights.
And we're working with our customers on a concept we call Signal-as-a-Service, where we set through massive
amounts of data using our massively parallel systems and capabilities and our uniquely differentiated way to get
real-time insights out of that data. And then working with a partner like ServiceNow, we can actually trigger
workflows in the ServiceNow environment to proactively address the assessments that are coming out of our AI
solution and analytics solution that we've put in place. And that is the agentic AI in operation.
So, from a Teradata perspective, we see the real opportunity to make agentic AI not just a buzzword, but a really
implementable solution for our customers at enterprise scale.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sheldon McMeans Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Understood. Thanks. And a quick follow-up, another one on the retention front. Can you kind of help us
understand how you think about the improvements of retention on a shifting customer perspective around
Teradata and some of the things you're doing on the cloud? And then more on maybe the execution side where
the customer success team is getting closer to the customer and improving execution?

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 06-May-2025
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. As we've been saying, we're seeing meaningful improvements in our retention rates. We always knew that
2024 is going to be an outlier from a retention rate perspective, but the improvement in retention rates that we
saw in – at the end of 2024 that are continuing into 2025 and we expect continue for the rest of the year are really
driven by a confluence of different factors.
I think one is, a new appreciation for our Teradata innovation and the technology set that we can drive. I think the
second thing is the business value that Teradata can deliver at enormous scale and how we can do that from a
very efficient and effective perspective. And then, I think the third thing and something that we're looking with as
the means to drive even more of is the innovation in the platform that we've delivered recently via end database
analytic capabilities that allows us to effectively compete with Databricks for new workloads or bringing AI/ML
models and had an open approach to bringing language models, either language models or large language
models, into the Teradata environment. That level of innovation is really capturing customer interest. It's enabling
us to deliver what we call innovation days to our customers, which are deploying brand-new use cases onto
Teradata as a result. So, it's a super exciting time in the market for us.

Patrick D. Walravens Q
Analyst, Citizens JMP Securities LLC
Oh, great. Thank you very much. So, Steve, I really like your hire of John Ederer. I've covered at, I think, three
companies in the past. So, can I ask what was it about that candidate that caused him to rise to the top of the list?
What is it that you were looking for that you saw in his background or skill set?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Hey, Pat. Thank you very much for the question. And we really like John too. We're really looking forward to
having him onboard. He's going to start with us next Monday. And as I said, he's been a public CFO in the past
and this is going to be his third stint. He's got great experience from a software perspective, a great experience in
terms of managing transactions. He's really successfully navigated for a number of organizations, and I think you
know, the transition towards a SaaS-based model. He knows what the KPIs are to drive that.
But he's also got a terrific operational capability in terms of driving operational results for an organization both on
the top line and the bottom line. So, we're very much looking forward to having John on the team with us. When
we set out the search and put the criteria that we wanted for the search, really, John stood out as an outstanding
candidate. He's going to be a great fit for us from a cultural perspective and we're really looking forward to having
him on the team.

Patrick D. Walravens Q
Analyst, Citizens JMP Securities LLC
Yeah, sorry. I think that was on my end. What's an example of something that you'd like him to tackle in the
beginning of his time with Teradata?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. I think he's going to spend some time and get his feet under the table. As we said through this call, we've
issued some really pragmatic guidance for the year. However, there are always areas in which we can improve.
And I think bringing in leaders like Sumeet and John gives them the opportunity to critically evaluate how we're
executing and how we're performing and take Teradata, bring that external experience to us in terms of how we
can operate more effectively, more efficiently, how we can drive the top line, how we can manage the business in
a much more controlled way and consistent way, and really deliver on that strategy of profitable growth.

on committed execution continues. And we know that our teams are out working with customers all around the
world to help them deliver trusted AI solutions. We've been very – we're very optimistic yet we're being pragmatic
in terms of how we're guiding. And we look forward to updating you next quarter. Thank you very much.

Olivier Pomel
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Thanks, Yuka, and thank all of you for joining us this morning to go through our results for Q3. Let me begin with
this quarter's business drivers. We have seen broad-based positive trends in the demand environment with an
ongoing strength of cloud migration and digital transformation. Against this backdrop, we executed on a very
strong Q3, both in new logo bookings and usage growth of existing customers.
As a notable inflection, we saw acceleration of year-over-year revenue growth across our non-AI customers. And
the sequential usage growth for non-AI existing customers was the highest we have seen going back 12 quarters.
This growth was broad-based as our customers are adopting more products and getting more value from the
Datadog platform.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 06-Nov-2025
We also experienced strong revenue growth for our AI-native customers and a broadening contribution to growth
among those customers. There, too, we saw an acceleration of growth in our AI cohort in Q3, when excluding our
largest customer.
Looking at new business, contribution from new customers increased in Q3, in both the amount of new customer
bookings as well as the revenue contribution from new customers. And as usual, churn has remained low, with
gross revenue retention stable in the mid- to high 90s, highlighting the mission-critical nature of our platform for
our customers.
Regarding our Q3 financial performance and key metrics, revenue was $886 million, an increase of 28% year-
over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended Q3 with about 32,000 customers, up from
about 29,200 a year ago. We also ended with about 4,060 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from
about 3,490 a year ago. These customers generated about 89% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of
$214 million, with a free cash flow margin of 24%.
Turning to platform adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. At the end of Q3, 84% of
customers were using two or more products, up from 83% a year ago. 54% of customers were using four or more
products, up from 49% a year ago. 31% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 26% a year
ago, and 16% of our customers were using eight or products, up from 12% a year ago.
Digital experience is an example of an area with no platform, where our rapid piece of innovation is turning into
tangible value for our customers. Our digital experience products include RUM, or Real User Monitoring, to
observe and improve application behavior in mobile and web apps; Synthetic, to user flows and proactively detect
user-facing issues; and Product Analytics, to help users connect application behavior to business impact.
Over the years, we've built our product breadth and depth in this area, and that is being recognized in the
marketplace. For the second year in a row, Datadog has been named the leader in the 2025 Gartner Magic
Quadrant for Digital Experience Monitoring. We are pleased that today, these digital experience products together
exceed $300 million in ARR. And this includes, in particular, a very fast ramp for Product Analytics, which has
already seen adoption by more than 1,000 customers.
We also want to call out our security suite of products, where we are executing and accelerating growth. Security
ARR growth was in the mid-50s as a percentage year-over-year in Q3, up from the mid-40s we mentioned last
quarter. We're starting to see success in including Cloud SIEM in larger deals and we'll get back to that in a bit in
our customer examples. And we're seeing positive trends beyond Cloud SIEM, including fast uptake of Code
Security and an increasing number of wins in Cloud Security. Overall, we saw year-over-year growth acceleration
in each one of our security products.
Moving on to R&D, we continue to deliver on what is a very ambitious AI roadmap. We are seeing high customer
interest in our Bits AI agents, which we announced at our DASH user conference in June. We have now
onboarded thousands of customers for preview access, the Bits AI SRE agent. And as we prepare for general
availability, we are getting very enthusiastic feedback on the time and cost savings enabled by Bits AI.
As one user recently told us, with Bits AI SRE being on-call 24/7 for us, mean time to resolution for our services
has improved significantly. For most cases, the investigation is already taken care of well before our engineers sit
down and open their laptops to assess the issue. And this is not an isolated comment. We see the potential here
for our agents who radically transform observability and operations.

In LLM Observability, we recently launched LLM Experiments and Playground for general availability, helping
teams to rapidly iterate on LLM applications and AI agents. We also launched custom LLM-as-a-judge evaluations
for general availability, which lets customers write evaluation prompts to assess application quality and safety.
As an illustration of growth and adoption in the past three months, the number of LLM spans customers are
sending to Datadog has more than quadrupled. And we are seeing a lot of interest in the Datadog MCP servers.
Our MCP server acts as a bridge between Datadog and AI agents, such as Codex by OpenAI, Claude Code by
Anthropic, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Goose by Block and many more.
Our preview customers are using real-time production data as a context to drive troubleshooting, root cause
analysis and automation in these agents. One user told us, the Datadog MCP server is a great tool. It enables me
to get the last five errors in my app and follow the spans and traces all the way to the root cause. I have never
been more hooked on Datadog. So we see MCP adoption as a great way to cement Datadog even further into our
customers' workflows.
Finally, we continue to see rising customer interest for next-gen AI Observability, with over 5,000 customers
sending us AI data through one or more of our AI integrations. On the topic of integrations, we are very proud to
now support over 1,000 integrations, which we believe is unparalleled in our space. By using our integration,
customer correlate otherwise disparate data sources across Datadog products for deeper analysis.
We can see from our customers' usage that this is a critical part of the Datadog platform. Our 32,000 customers
use more than 50 integrations on average, while customers spending over $1 million annually with us use more
than 150. And most importantly, as tech stacks evolve, we continue to update and expand our integrations so our
customers can use Datadog to deploy new technologies with confidence.
Last but not least, I wanted to give a shout-out to our AI research team for the amazing work they have published.
Our Toto open-weights time series forecasting model has been one of the top downloads on Hugging Face over
the past few months and that is across all categories. It is very impactful as, among other things, the high quality
of this work allows us to attract world-class AI researchers and engineers.
Now, let's move on to sales and marketing. We had a number of great new logo wins in customer expansions this
quarter. So I'll go through a few of them. First, we landed a seven-figure annualized deal with a leading European
telco, our largest ever land deal in Europe. This company's previous setup was expensive, inefficient and wasn't
scaling to meet their needs. By using Datadog, they expect to save over $1 million annually on tool cost alone,
along with millions of dollars more in reduced operation costs, lower engineering time and avoidance of revenue
loss. They will adopt 11 Datadog products to start and will consolidate more than 10 commercial and open-source
tools.
Next, we landed a seven-figure annualized deal with a leading financial risk and analytics company. The
company's fragmented tooling has led to major incidents that sometimes took multiple days and hundreds of
engineers to resolve. They plan to start with 11 Datadog products, including On-Call, Cloud SIEM and Bits AI, and
will replace 14 commercial, open-source and hyperscaler observability tools.
Next, we landed a seven-figure annualized deal with a Fortune 500 technology hardware company. This is an
exciting win for our new go-to-market motions, targeting the largest and most sophisticated companies in the
world. Datadog has been chosen as their strategic observability partner and we are displacing commercial tools
across observability, Cloud SIEM and incident response. This customer is starting with 14 Datadog products.

Next, we signed a seven-figure annualized expansion with a Fortune 500 financial services company. This
customer had pockets of siloed teams and data, including one business unit, which manually hosted and
maintained 93 separate instances of open-source tooling. With this expansion, this company will adopt 15
Datadog products, including all three pillars in all of their business units. They will also replace their SIEM solution
with Datadog Cloud SIEM in a seven-figure land deal for Cloud SIEM. And by bringing all their telemetry data into
the Datadog platform, they expect better insights for their adoption of Bits AI SRE agent today and Bits AI
Security Analyst [indiscernible] (00:11:54).
Next, we signed a seven-figure annualized expansion with a Fortune 500 heavy equipment company. With this
expansion, this customer will replace its open-source log solution with Datadog Log Management and Flex Logs.
They plan to adopt LLM Observability and their IT team is using Cloud Cost Management to improve cost visibility
and governance.
Next, we welcome back a leading vertical SaaS company with a seven-figure annualized deal. By returning to
Datadog, this customer benefits from more alignment with OpenTelemetry and will implement the incident and
reliability processes that they were unable to execute on previously.
Next, we signed a seven-figure annualized expansion with a major American carmaker. This customer is adopting
Datadog products faster than previously expected and this agreement supports their higher usage. With this
expansion, they will adopt Datadog Incident Management and On-Call solutions company-wide for a total of 5,000
users who support operational continuity across the business.
Finally, we signed a nine-figure annualized expansion with a leading AI company. This company has been a long-
time Datadog customer and has expanded their usage of multiple products, securing better economics for a
higher commitment with an early renewal.
Speaking of AI customers, we continue to help AI-native customers, big and small, to grow and scale their
businesses. And we continue to see this group broaden in number and size with more than 500 AI-native
companies in this group, about 100 of which are spending more than $100,000 annually with Datadog and more
than 15 who are spending more than $1 million annually with us. While we know there's a lot of attention on this
cohort, we primarily see it as an indication of what's to come as companies of every size and every single industry
incorporate AI into their cloud applications. And that's it for another very strong quarter from our go-to-market
teams, who are now very hard at work as we have a really exciting pipeline for Q4.
Before I turn it over to David for a financial review, I want to say a few words on our longer-term outlook. There is
no change to our overall view that digital transformation and cloud migration are long-term secular growth drivers
of our business.
Meanwhile, we are advancing rapidly in AI, where we are incredibly excited about our opportunities. We're
building a comprehensive set of AI Observability products to help our customers tackle the higher complexity that
comes with these technologies. And we are building AI into Datadog, and I spoke earlier about the excitement our
customers have for our Bits AI agents.
The market opportunity in cloud and AI is expected to grow rapidly into the trillions of dollars and companies of
every size and industry are looking to adopt AI to deliver value to their customers and drive positive business
outcome. So we're moving fast to help our customers develop, deploy and grow into the cloud and into the AI
world.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 06-Nov-2025
With that, I will turn it over to our CFO. David?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Thanks, Olivier. To start, our Q3 revenue was $886 million, up 28% year-over-year and up 7% quarter-over-
quarter.
To dive into some of the drivers of our Q3 revenue growth: first, overall, we saw sequential usage growth from
existing customers in Q3 that was higher than our expectations and the strongest in 12 quarters in our non-AI-
native customer base. We saw year-over-year growth acceleration broadly across our business, including in new
logos and existing customers, both enterprise and SMB, with customers across our spending bands, big and
small, and customers in a wide variety of industries.
Next, we saw strong and accelerating contribution from new customers. New logo annualized bookings more than
doubled year-over-year and set a new record, driven by an increase in average new logo land size, particularly in
enterprise. We believe we are starting to see the benefits of our growth of sales capacity, and we are seeing new
logos ramping faster, contributing more to revenue growth. The portion of our year-over-year revenue growth that
related to new customers was about 25% in Q3, up from 20% in Q2.
Next, our AI-native customers continue to exhibit rapid growth, while more customers in this group are growing to
be sizable customers. As Olivier discussed, we extended the contract of our largest AI native customer. In
addition, we now have more larger AI customers, including 15 of them spending $1 million or more annually with
Datadog, and about 100 spending more than $100,000 annually.
Year-over-year revenue growth from our AI-native customers, excluding the largest customer, again, accelerated
in Q3. In Q3, this group represented 12% of our revenue, up from 11% last quarter and about 6% in the year ago
quarter. I will note that, over time, we think this metric will become less relevant, as AI usage in production
broadens beyond this group of customers.
Our year-over-year revenue growth also accelerated amongst our non-AI-native customers. In Q3, our revenue
growth, excluding the AI-native customer group, was 20% year-over-year, accelerating from 18% year-over-year
in Q2. And we have seen this trend of accelerating growth continue in October. Regarding retention metrics, our
trailing 12-month net revenue retention percentage was 120%, similar to last quarter, and our trailing 12-month
gross revenue retention percentage remain in the mid- to high 90s.
And now, moving on to our financial results. Our billings were $893 million, up 30% year-over-year. Our remaining
performance obligations, or RPO, was $2.79 billion, up 53% year-over-year, and current RPO growth was in the
low 50s percentage year-over-year. Our strong bookings contributed to this acceleration of RPO. We continue to
believe that revenue is a better indication of our trends in our business than billings and RPO.
And now, let's review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-
GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. First, gross
profit in the quarter was $719 million and our gross margin was 81.2%. This compares to a gross margin of 80.9%
last quarter and 81.1% in the year ago quarter. As previously mentioned, we continue to see the impact of our
engineers' cost-saving efforts in Q3 as they deliver on our cloud efficiency projects.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 06-Nov-2025
Our Q3 OpEx grew 30% – 32%, excuse me, year-over-year, down from 36% last quarter. We continue to grow
our investments to pursue our long-term growth opportunities. And this OpEx growth is an indication of our
execution on our hiring plan. Q3 operating income was $207 million for a 23% operating margin compared to 20%
last quarter and 25% in the year ago quarter.
And now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $4.1 billion in cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities, and cash flow from operations was $251 billion in the quarter. After
taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $214 million for a free
cash flow margin of 24%.
And now for our outlook for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2025. First, our guidance philosophy overall
remains unchanged. As a reminder, we based our guidance on trends observed in recent months and imply
conservatism on these growth trends.
So, for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $912 million to $916 million, which represents a
24% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $216 million to $220
million, which implies an operating margin of 24%. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the
range of $0.54 to $0.56 per share based on approximately 367 million weighted average diluted shares
outstanding.
And for the full year – fiscal year 2025, we expect revenues to be in the range of $3.386 billion to $3.390 billion,
which represents 26% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $754
million to $758 million, which implies an operating margin of 22%. And non-GAAP net income per share is
expected to be in the range of $2 to $2.02 per share, based on 364 million weighted average diluted shares.
And finally, some additional notes on our guidance. We expect net interest and other income for the fiscal year
2025 to be approximately $170 million. We continue to expect cash taxes in 2025 to be about $10 million to $20
million and we continue to apply a 21% non-GAAP tax rate for 2025 and going forward.
And finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be 4% of revenues in fiscal year
2025.
To summarize, we are pleased with our execution in Q3. We are well-positioned to help our existing and
prospective customers with their cloud migration and digital transformation journeys, including their adoption of AI.
And I want to thank Datadog's worldwide for their efforts.
And with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our
first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kash Rangan Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hi. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Congratulations on the spectacular results and the showing of sequential
improvement across the board. Oliver, I had a question for you. We've talked about GPU monetization versus
CPU monetization. So how closer are we to the point where you can confidently expand and get your share of the
customer wallet when it comes to whether it's training workload, inferencing workload on the GPU clusters, which
are becoming more prevalent and increasingly a larger part of the compute buildout in the future? That's it from
me. Thank you so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. So we have products that are getting into the market now for GPU monitoring, but these don't generate any
significant revenue yet. So all the revenues we've shared, like the acceleration, et cetera, that's not related to us
capitalizing more on GPUs. That's a future opportunity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh
of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjit K. Singh Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. Thank you for taking the questions. And congrats on the acceleration in growth this quarter. Olivier, I
wanted to talk about some of those enterprise trends you're seeing in sort of your non-AI cohort. What do you sort
of put the improved performance and growth this quarter on? You mentioned that the sales productivity or the
benefits from some of the sales investments starting to come online. Is there sort of an uplift in sort of the cloud
migration trends? Are you starting to see enterprise build more AI applications? I just love to get your perspective
on the underlying trends in the enterprise and the mid-market business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. I'd say there's three parts to it. One part is the demand environment is not – is positive in general. I don't
know that we see massive acceleration of cloud migration, but at least the environment is not pushing the other
way. We know which happens from time to time. So that's point number one.
Point number two is, we've been growing sales capacity quite a bit and we've created new go-to-market motions
to go after the kind of customers we were not getting before. Like, we've done quite a bit of investment over the
past couple of years and we see that starting to pay off. As I said also, we feel good about the Q4 in terms of
pipeline on the sales side. So it's too early to tell yet. We still have to close those deals, but we feel good about
the scaling of our go-to-market.

And point number three is, we have a number of products that we've been developing over the years. Some of
them are early, some of them a little bit further along, that are really clicking. We see – we have a lot of success.
We're getting large prices to adopt Flex Logs, for example. We have a lot of success with some of new products
such as Product Analytics that we mentioned on the call. We're seeing some large land deals with our Cloud
SIEM. So all of that is contributing to the picture you're seeing today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjit K. Singh Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And just as a follow-up on the AI observability opportunity. When you look at some of the independent software
vendors that are releasing agentic solutions, agentic portfolios, a number of them are including observability as
part of their sort of value proposition. Is there any work you think Datadog has to do to sort of infiltrate that market
or make sure that customers look to Datadog as that agentic monitoring capability, as some of these independent
software vendors try to bundle in observability into their solutions? I would love to get your perspective on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, there's absolutely no doubt to us that the customers will need and want a unified platform for
observability for all of these. There's two parts to that. One is, historically, every single piece of software we
integrate with, whether that's SaaS or things that customers run themselves, also has its own management
console and observability console, but you're not going to log into 17, or in the case of our customers we
mentioned that they use 60 integrations for the smaller customers, 150 integrations for the larger ones, it's not
practical to actually go and manage that separately. So, we think all of that belong in a central place and that's the
historical trend we've seen.
We also think that you can't separate the AI parts from the non-AI parts of the business. So, you're not going to
look at your agents separately like you really do at your web hosting and your database and your – everything
else that you have in your stack. So all of that in the end will be attached to observability.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Raimo Lenschow Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Perfect. Congrats from me as well. That sounded like an amazing quarter and nice to see it coming together. On
the AI side, and I don't want to talk about the big customer, but more the other ones, like 15 customers over $1
million, that's like a big number and 100 over $100,000. How do I have to think about the nature of those? Is this
kind of – are those kind of – especially the bigger ones, those kind of model builders? But then even 15 is a big
number and over 100 sounds like this whole new application world that we've all been kind of waiting for starting
to come together. Is that kind of what's going on there? Because it does sound quite exciting and much more
broader than we thought. Thank you.

Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
It's actually fairly broad. So there is model vendors, there's models – model that can be the LLMs, model that can
be video, it can be sound generation, it can be all of the various parts of the stack you see as independent
companies. It can be – there's quite a few companies that do that work on the coding side, so coding assistance
and vibe coders and everything in that range.
Some of these are very new companies. Some of these are not very new companies. Some of these started five,
seven, eight years ago, and were sort of not necessarily AI-native from day one, but very quickly that would give
them the growth they see today with the pivot to AI. So we see a little bit of that.
We have companies that are other parts of the stack in AI on the, say, the serving side, the other components of
the infrastructure. And we have other companies that are more purely applications built with AI. So we have a bit
of everything in there. Like, it's actually fairly representative of the space.

of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark R. Murphy Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you so much. You had mentioned the expansion of the contract with your largest AI-native customer. And I
believe you said better economics for a higher commitment. Can you speak to that? Because I would assume a
higher commitment would carry a volume-based discount. I'm just trying to understand if – for some reason, if that
was not the case here, what did you mean by better economics? And then I have a quick follow-up, Olivier.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah, yeah. I mean, look, this is – without getting into the detail of any specific customer, like this is – the motion
is always the same. Like, customers grow. They commit to more. They get better prices. So you see – again,
talking about customers in general, you see growth of usage, drops in revenue as customers renew and get a
higher commit and a better price, and then usually growth after that for those customers. That's the motion that
we've had. We have about 30,000 customers so far.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark R. Murphy Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And the – what – so the better economics part of it is netting out like 12 months down the road. Is that what
you mean?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Well, the better economics means you commit to more, you get a better price. And as we – remember, we have a
usage model. So we charge people every month on what they use at the price that you – at the price we agreed.

So if you get better economics and your usage is somewhat similar month to month [indiscernible] (00:32:40). But
the overall backdrop of our business is increased consumption.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark R. Murphy Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, Olivier, the acceleration that you saw in security growth is pretty noticeable,
too. We recall, I think about six months ago, you had ramped up and engaged a lot more of a channel partners,
which is a key ingredient that you grow in a security business. Is it a function of that? Or is there a mindset
change happening out there where customers want observability to be the central point of collection so that all the
security teams and the ops teams are working with the same set of metrics and logs and tracers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Look, I think it's a number of things. Definitely, we've been investing in the channel. And that's certainly helpful to
do the security business as a whole. The big wins we mentioned on security, that we mentioned a couple of wins
in Cloud SIEM, this tend to be more related to product maturity, the strength of our underlying platform, especially
when it comes to technology like Flex Logs, for example. And the fact also that we've been learning how to
properly go-to-market for security. And I think we still have been clicking in a way that is exciting.

Fatima Boolani Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Oli, I'll start with you and I have a follow-up for Dave. On the
On-Call product, Oli, how do agentic advancements, in general, detract or enhance the value proposition here?
And I'm very simplistically thinking about the core nature and value proposition of the On-Call product intelligently
routing requests for remediation, right? So how do just broader advancements in AI help beef up and/or detract
your ability to monetize this product? And then just a follow-up for David, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Well, I mean, look, if you zoom out, we entered this year with On-Call because we wanted to own the end-to-end
incident resolution. So we wanted – before that, we were detecting the incidents and sending the alerts. And then
we were pretty much where the resolution happened after that. Customers were spending their time in Datadog to
diagnose and understand what was going on. So we wanted to own the full cycle. And we thought that with AI, in
particular, we'd have the ability to do things if we own the whole cycle that we couldn't do otherwise.
So what you see right now is, I mean, this resonates with customers. They're adopting the product. We've
mentioned, like, some exciting customers with, like, say, one with 5,000 seats for On-Call, which is very exciting.
But in the future, there's many more things we can do and we're working on for that product. If we both detect

incident and notify, we can do some subtle things such as even predicting the incident and notifying early, or
rerouting early or telling people before the incident actually takes place, how they can potentially fix it.
So these are all things we're working on. I mean, look, if you look at the various product announcements we've
made, whether that's Bits AI SRE or the time series forecasting model we released, when you assemble all that,
you get to a very, very interesting picture of what we can do in the future. So we're excited about that. Our
customers are excited by the vision there, too. And that's why this product is successful.

Fatima Boolani Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Appreciate that. David, on net retention rates, why aren't we necessarily seeing more upward pressure on the
metric, just given the strength of expansionary bookings that you alluded to in the quarter from the installed base?
And I mean, I suspect it's because it's a trailing 12-month metric, but any directional color you can just share on
that and any high-level commentary on some of the non-AI-native net retention rate trend behavior. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah, you've nailed it. I mean, it's a trailing 12 months. It's a number that's rounded. It has the dynamics that you
might expect in that. The growth of the non-AI-natives has been, as we mentioned, a combination of landing and
expanding at higher rates than we've seen in recent quarters. So if that continues, as you go into a trailing 12-
month metric, you see a directional movement.

Hey, great. Thanks for taking the question. Oli, David, Bits AI seems like a really exciting thing out of DASH. And I
know it's still in preview, but you mentioned there's a lot of interest there. So I'm just curious how you think about
the agentic opportunity with Bits AI. How meaningful this can be for 2026 as a differentiator versus competition
and also as a revenue contributor? Thanks.

Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. So, I mean, look, it's super exciting. The feedback's very good on it. I mean, we've been collecting all the –
so I read one quote, we have dozens that look just like that, that was sent to us by customers. And so that's very,
very exciting. We also started having some customers buy and come to it just to show value and to make sure we
were on to the right product mix. And so we feel good that this is something that is high quality and we can
monetize.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 06-Nov-2025
In terms of the impact for next year, on the packaging side, I'm not completely sure yet whether the biggest impact
will be seen from what we charge for Bits AI itself or for the rest of the platform that it gets benefits from the
differentiation of Bits AI. I think that's more of a broader question of packaging and monetization of AI.
And remember that we have a product that is usage-based. So, anything that drives usage up and adoption from
customers is good for us and is very, very monetizable. But what we can tell is this is differentiating. This is good.
It works significantly better than anything else we've seen or heard of in the market, and we're doubling down on
it. We have many, many teams now working on deepening Bits AI SREs to making sure it goes further into the
resolution, doesn't just point to the issue, but fixes the code, all these kinds of things. We're working hard on that.
We're also working on breadth, making sure that we train it on many more types of data, many types of sources,
sometimes even systems that are – observability systems that are not Datadog so we can cut across to other
systems our customers are using. So we're very, very aggressively developing Bits AI SRE. It's resonating very
well in the market.

Gray Powell Q
Analyst, BTIG LLC
Oh, great. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the great results. So maybe just like taking a
step back. If we go back to the beginning of the year, Datadog was expecting 19% revenue growth. It looks like
you're tracking to something over 26% growth now. And that's just the high end of your guidance. So, I guess my
question is, what surprised you the most this year? And then just how do you feel about the sustainability of those
drivers as you look forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
I mean, look, the – so first, I apologize for over-delivering on the results. We might do it again, but we'll see. I think
the biggest surprise for us has been that the – so AI in general has – or AI adoption has grown faster than we
thought it would at the beginning of the year. So, we've seen that across our AI cohort. We've seen also that we
got some of our new products and new – like the changes we were making on the go-to-market side to click
perhaps earlier than we would have thought otherwise. So all in all, we saw the leading part of the business with
AI grow faster, the – not the lagging, but the slower growing, more traditional part of the business also accelerate.
And that gets us where we are today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
And I'd add, we have a good demand environment. And we've been investing, whether it be in the products that
Oli's been talking about or in the sales capacity. We made clear that we were in investment mode and we're
seeing those investments pay off.

Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Koji Ikeda Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just one for me here. I wanted to ask a question on the
inflection in the non-AI-native growth and how to think about the areas of strength in this cohort. Is it coming from
your largest enterprises? Is it coming from a certain type of customer? Is there a common theme in the workloads
that you're seeing or the products that are being added on that is driving that strength, or is it just really just broad-
based? What I'm trying to get at here is I'm really trying to understand more the durability of this growth inflection.
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
So, it is broad based. And I think, again, it speaks to a couple of things. It speaks to the fact that, in general, the
demand environment is good. Though I would say there's been a very, very high growth of hyperscaler revenue,
like, over the past – or an acceleration for the hyperscalers in general. A lot of that is GPU-related, but the growth
we're seeing here and the acceleration we're seeing here is largely not GPU-related. There's a little bit of it, but
not a ton of it. So that's not exactly what you've seen with some of the other vendors there.
One reason this is broad-based is these are the same products we sell to all customers. And this is largely the
same go-to-market organization that we have a few segments, but – and we've been doing well at executing
there. Like, I think we've invested quite a bit in product and we keep – and we will keep doing it, and we see the
results of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. I want to – I'll add that it's across the customer base, enterprise, SMB. And when we look at it, it is not just
an AI SMB. If you remove those AI companies, you still see a strengthening SMB demand cycle going on. And
unlike in previous periods, it also is across spending ranges. We're not seeing larger spenders or smaller
spenders. We're just seeing a broad trend of improved demand across the spending trends.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
And remember that, for us, SMB is any company of less than 1,000 employees.

David M. Obstler A

Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ittai Kidron Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Thanks and congrats, guys. Really great numbers. Oli, in your answer to one of the questions and kind of going
into the drivers behind the upside, you've talked about sales capacity increase. You didn't talk a much about sales
efficiency. Is there a way you can give us some color on where do you stand on percent of salespeople that are
hitting quota? Where does that ratio stand relative to historical patterns for you guys? And as you approach 2026
year, do you anticipate any material changes in the comp structure, just given the breadth of product and the list
of opportunities? How do you get people focused?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. So, look, we feel good about the sales productivity, in general. And the rule generally is, you grow by
scaling capacity and maintaining productivity. It's hard to drive both up at the same time. And remember, if you
want to grow to 10x, you can do that by scaling. If you can't really do it by improving productivity, so you have to
scale. And we've been doing that and we've been successful at it so far.
In terms of the compliance, look we keep changing the way we compensate and the way we manage the sales
force in general to make sure we have the right focus. One of the gifts of a business model like ours is that we
feel we have a very heavy land and expand model. And so we get a lot of growth from existing customers. The
challenge it create, on the other hand, is how do we get to focus the sales force on the newer customers, the
smaller ones and the new ones, because it is more work to get an extra dollar for a smaller customer or from a
new one than it is from an existing one that they already have scaled.
And so a lot of the tweaks we make to our compliance related to that. Who do we grow? Who do we make sure
we direct our attention and we reward people for what is going to generate the most long-term growth for us? And
we've made a number of changes. I won't go through them. These are internal changes, but we made a number
of changes this year. We see a number of them pay off.
Another thing I mentioned on the call was, we mentioned the wins for one of our new go-to-market motions. And
that's specifically getting in place multiyear plans to go after some larger customers that are tougher to land than
what we've done in the past. And sometimes it takes more than a year to land certain types of customers. And the
problem is, if your comp plan only has a one-year horizon, like it doesn't give a great incentive for the sales force
to go after those customers. And so we cordoned off a few of those companies. We have special plans to go after
that. And we're starting to see success with that, too. This is just an example.

Oh, great. Thank you and congrats. I know you have a team focused on the Fortune 500, where there's still a lot
of white space for you. Curious to hear how they – that team's ramping to productivity. Did that help drive some of
the strong new logo bookings? And can this contribute even more next year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, look, this is not new, right? I mean, we've been focusing on that for many years, and we're tracking
well. One thing I was mentioning just before was one challenge even in the Fortune 500 is to make sure that we
focus on landing new customers and make sure that there's a right amount of sales attention and reward for
landing a customer, even if it's for a small amount. And I think we've done well. I mean, again, we can comment
on that again after the next quarter when we have a full year of our new plans that have been validated. But so
far, we feel very good about it.

Alex Zukin Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on dropping some truly inspiring quotes in the
script. Maybe, Oli, one for you and then I have a quick follow-up for David. Just the duration of this acceleration of
the non-AI cohort, it seems like from all your forward-looking metrics, whether it's billings, RPO, CRPO, those
were, again, really, really strong. How long do you think we should think about the duration of this trend of this
non-AI acceleration?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Well, we're a consumption business. So we – the hardest thing to understand is what the future is going to look
like for consumption. The way I would say it is, we feel very good about it at the midterm and long term. Now, how
it ebbs and flows in a given month or quarter, that's harder to tell. And again, that's what we've seen through the
life of the company.
So, what we feel very confident about, though, is the motion, in general, for digital transformation and cloud
migration is steady. And sometimes, it slows down a little bit, but it reaccelerates after that. And we see that going
on for a very long time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alex Zukin Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. And then maybe just, David, for you. Look, gross profit dollar acceleration, while you're seeing your largest
customer kind of get better unit economics, is also inspiring to see. How should we think about the progression of
gross margins and gross profit dollar growth, particularly as you continue to also see the AI cohort acceleration?

David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. There's a couple things. I think we've mentioned that we've been focused and have focused over the many
years on the efficiency of our cloud platform. We have significant engineering efforts around cost of sales and
delivery of value. And so we've been able to deliver on that.
We also have a very broad customer base distributed in terms of volume. So as customers get larger and maybe
get volume discounts, we have a number – a lot of customers coming in at smaller, so that balance there. And
then in terms of sort of the future, I repeat what we've always said that we've been running the company with a
gross margin, plus or minus 80%, we've given that range and not changed it, and we watch it. And it gives us
signals in terms of efficiency, how we're operating. It gives us signals in pricing and things like that. And I wouldn't
change the comments we made over the many years about looking at that and then developing operations and
strategies around that.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A

No, I mean, we don't provide that kind of information on individual customers. We're trying to give a picture of the
overall business. Generally, I think, as Oli mentioned, on our larger customers, we have a motion of the
expansion of volume. And then we talk – then we work on the term and the volume-based pricing. But we don't
give guidance like that on individual customers.

Mike Cikos Q
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. I just wanted to come back to it, Oli, for the non-AI-native strength, I
know we've kind of hit on this a number of times, whether it's roadmap, sales capacity, executions, but like kudos
on the numbers here. I'm just trying to get a better sense of the why now. Is it just a composite of all those
different pieces clicking together this quarter or is there anything more to unpack there? And then I have a follow-
up for David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A

Again, I don't think there's a lot more to unpack there. And I know it's boring in a way, but it's also the way we've

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Cikos Q
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC
Awesome. Awesome to hear. Okay. And then for the follow-up to David, David, I don't want to take anything away
from the Q3 results you guys just posted, and we obviously have the strong guide here for Q4. But I just can
imagine myself a month from now starting to get inbounds from certain folks asking about the holiday season and
the fact that we have – the holiday is landing on weekdays in Q4 here. Can you just kind of discuss how you
thought about constructing guidance for this Q4 here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. We have years of experience of analyzing the day-by-day patterns. In the holidays, we know that the
holiday period ends up in the usage side because of vacation holidays and we incorporate that into our guidance.
We're, I think, evolved a lot over the years in sort of days adjusted, types of days, et cetera. And so we will be
incorporating that like we've incorporated in other years. If there are differences in this calendar period, we
incorporate that as always.

Okay. Great. Thank you. I'll ask one for David and one for Olivier. David, first of all, congratulations on the
extension of the larger contract. I think everybody on the line is applauding that. I know you're reticent to get into
any details, but maybe I could try. Are you able to clarify whether that was a one-year deal or multiyear? And then
related to that, David, what is the contribution to CRPO from that deal, which I presume landed in your CRPO
number? If it is a one-year deal, does the entirety of that contract contribute to the sequential CRPO performance
in the quarter? So that's it for you, David.

And then, Olivier, maybe I'll just ask both at once. Some of the very large AI natives are beginning to diversify to
utilizing Oracle's OCI and Stargate. And I'm wondering, what's the opportunity for Datadog to essentially follow
that behavior and begin scaling on Oracle, Stargate? Or because a lot of what Oracle is doing with the AI natives
is training clusters, perhaps that near-term opportunity is more limited? Thank you both.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. On the first point, I think we give a lot of examples. And our motion, which our customers would be
following, including that one, would be we fix out annual-plus commits. We're not commenting on individual
contracts here, but it would follow a typical path to other types of contracts. So that's what we would do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. And on OCI, look, we've built an OCI integration and we see more demand from customers on OCI. Some
of the things we see, like the Stargate, et cetera, like, these are extremely custom-built apps. Like, I don't know –
they're not necessarily exactly cloud because they are custom-built for specific customers. So the opportunity
there is more remote today. But it's – again, if one company use that, it's a not fantastic opportunity to productize;
but if 10, 15, 20, 50 companies start using that, then that really becomes a commercial opportunity. And so we are
very much plugged into all of that and we go basically where our customers are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
I think you mentioned about the RPO. No, I think in this case, we've mentioned this current and the total is roughly
the same. And there wouldn't be anything in that contract that would have been materially around those numbers.
Those numbers, I think we mentioned, are produced from the bookings growth more generally and not from that
particular contract.

Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the recent go-to-market investments, obviously, it seems like there's
been a lot of traction thus far with those. So, I'm curious if there are any areas like security or the new logos or
upmarket that you could look to lean even deeper into, just given the growth that you've seen here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah, definitely. And that's something we didn't do this year that we're definitely going to do next year. So there's
a number of things. We're in Q4, right? So we're in the middle of planning for next year. And we basically will keep
scaling what's working, stop doing some of the things that are not conclusive and then try a few more things.

That's the way it works. Interestingly enough, building a go-to-market is not that different from building software.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jake Roberge Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
That's helpful. And then just on the new Bits AI agents, can you just talk about the early feedback that you've
gotten for those solutions and maybe how the engagement with those agents has compared to kind of the ramp of
security Flex Logs? I know, obviously, much earlier days, but just how it compared when those were still largely in
the preview phase.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
I mean, look, the Bits AI SRE agent is – it really has a role factor for customers. So what works really well is, and
we've seen that a number of times, like they – we set it up for them, it's running on their alerts and they go
through an outage and they still go through the motion. So they still go – they still set up a bridge and they have
20 people and they spend two hours. And in the end, they have an idea of what went wrong. And then they go to
Datadog and they see, oh, wait, there's an investigation that had run. And three minutes into the outage, it got the
same conclusion that we got two hours later with 20 people on the call. And that's completely eye opening for
customers when they see that. And we have – that's why we get many quotes about it.
So now, there's more we need to do there. Like customers say, oh, this is great. Now, can you make the fix for
me? Can you do this? Can you do that? Can you support that other system that right now you can't actually set it
up for? So we have a very, very full roadmap of things we need to do and we're doubling down on it.
We also shipped – I mean, this one is in preview, but we shipped a security agent that looks at vulnerabilities and
looks at security signals and does triage that basically look at the trends and investigate what might be benign or
what might be a real issue. We also are getting very, very positive feedback for that. And in fact, that's what
helped us win some large land deals for our Cloud SIEM products. The combination of the SIEM that runs
extremely efficiently on top of observability data, that runs very efficiently on top of Flex Logs, but also saves an
immense amount of time by getting 90% of the issues out of the way with automated investigations. That's
extremely attractive to customers.

All right. And I think with that, we're going to close the call. So, before we go, I just want to give one quick shout
out to the team, because I know, as I said earlier, we have quite a lot going on in Q4, whether it's on the planning
side, on the product building side or on the sales side, where I said we have a really exciting pipeline. And so we
have a lot to do. I want to thank the team for their hard work there. Also, I'm looking forward to meeting a lot of our
existing and new customers at AWS re:Invent in a few weeks, and I'll see you all there. Thank you all.

Sridhar Ramaswamy
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Thanks, Jimmy, and hi, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. What a difference a year makes. It was on
this call last year that I was introduced to you as Snowflake's new CEO. I look at the progress we have made in
just one year, and I could not be more proud of our team. Our core business is very strong. Our product delivery
is in overdrive, and our go-to-market engine is humming. We're innovating better than ever and firing on all
cylinders. And we have an enormous opportunity ahead of us.
Right now, Snowflake is the most consequential data and AI company on the planet. As I said in our third quarter
call, our North Star is to deliver the world's best end-to-end data platform powered by AI and we are making great
progress every day to deliver on that vision. I'm incredibly proud of the operational rigor we have incorporated into
our company, delivering greater efficiency while also aggressively investing and delivering on growth.
And our focus on our customers has never been stronger. We continue to hear how easy and cost-effective our
platform is. And we are hitting more and more multiproduct adoption because of the tremendous value we are
delivering to our customers. We're keeping our feet on the gas. We are building on our strengths and going after
the opportunities ahead with urgency and focus to ensure we continue our strong momentum throughout this
year. You can see this progress in our strong fourth quarter results. We're just getting started.
Product revenue for Q4 was $943 million, up a strong 28% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations
totaled $6.9 billion with year-over-year growth of 33%. Our net revenue retention was a very healthy 126%. In the
quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin increased to 9%. And our non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin
was 43%. As you can see, we delivered another quarter of strong revenue growth and overall very healthy
results.
As I said last quarter, we are obsessed with driving product cohesion. We are continuing to win in the market
because Snowflake is easy to use, helps customer break down silos to collaborate and be connected and is
trusted by companies of all sizes and industries. This is why iconic brands like ExxonMobil, Honeywell, the
London Stock Exchange Group, and thousands more are betting their business on Snowflake.
Fiserv, a global provider of payments and financial technology, for example, is transforming how businesses and
financial institutions use data by providing them with their own analytics platform through Snowflake. This
empowers Fiserv customers to have access to insights from their transaction data, combine it with market
information and train their own AI models, enabling smarter business decisions that were previously only possible
for a large enterprise.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call 26-Feb-2025
Last quarter, we had our BUILD summit, our biggest event of the year for our builders and developers, followed
by regional meet-ups and events around the world. So far, a record of more than 20,000 attendees have joined
these events, showing incredible momentum and excitement for our product vision. We continue to hear how we
are making it simpler to develop, build, and innovate on our platform. More and more customers are switching to
Snowflake and realizing the incredible ease of use and cost savings our platform delivers.
We are also helping our customers develop entirely new revenue streams to monetize their data. For example,
supply chain leader, Blue Yonder, leverages Snowflake's robust data management capabilities and scale to help
companies transform their operations by offering AI-powered insights.
The Blue Yonder platform processes over 20 billion AI predictions daily to help retailers, manufacturers and
logistics providers better manage inventory, optimize deliveries and respond to disruptions. It enables their
customers to access powerful supply chain intelligence that would be impossible to build on their own.
As our competitors continue to require expensive engineering resources to maintain and scale, more and more
customers are seeing real bottom line impact by turning to Snowflake. We have seen more and more Snowflake
customers save over 50% by migrating to us from other providers. In fact, we recently announced that
SnowConvert, Snowflake's native code conversion tooling, is now free for anyone to help accelerate migrations
from Oracle, Teradata, and many other systems to realize these benefits in data analytics.
Snowflake is also the de facto circulatory system in the enterprise world. The ability to collaborate and share data
is one of our core differentiators. We are seeing strong adoption of our data sharing capabilities with customers
like Stripe, NTT, and Braze which each have active data sharing connections with over 160 partner and customer
organizations.
These connections enabled them to securely exchange data with their partners and customers, driving value
across our ecosystem. We are continuing to innovate at lightning speed. This past year, we brought over 400
product capabilities to market over double the amount we launched the previous year.
We have seen incredible growth in our data engineering business and continue to see strong adoption of open
data formats, especially truly open modern data formats like Apache Iceberg, which is transforming how
organizations manage and query data at scale. We've also seen amazing growth in the number of companies
building and collaborating on Snowflake with over a-third of our capacity customers collaborating with data on a
regular basis. When it comes to AI, last year was foundational for us. We introduced Cortex AI, which is now
being used by customers to seamlessly build data agents for both structured and unstructured data with state-of-
the-art retrieval using Cortex Search and Analyst.
We are supporting a range of market-leading models, including Anthropic's Claude, Meta's Llama and DeepSeek.
And I am sure, you saw that we just announced our expanded partnership with Microsoft that brings OpenAI's
models into Cortex. This makes us the only data platform to seamlessly host both Anthropic's and OpenAI's
world-leading models, enabling our customers to build data agents while ensuring that their data remains secure
in Snowflake.
And just a few weeks ago, we introduced Cortex Agents, a world-class agent orchestration framework to enable
seamless planning and execution of tasks across structured and unstructured data, all powered by leading
models such as Anthropic's Claude. They leveraged Cortex Analyst and Cortex Search to deliver state-of-the-art
accuracy, along with enterprise-grade reliability and governance, so customers can build agents at scale.

And today, we announced that we are deepening our partnership with Microsoft. We are making Cortex Agents
available in Microsoft 365 CoPilot and Microsoft Teams, bringing millions of users seamless access to information
and accelerated productivity, all within the Microsoft platform.
All of these innovations are focused on driving real value for our customers. They make it easy for people to
create a chatbot on structured or unstructured data. And these in turn are the essential building block for a strong
AI foundation, as we head to the next inflection point with Agents.
We now have over 4,000 customers using our AI and ML technology on a weekly basis. Take AstraZeneca. They
are harnessing the power of data in Snowflake to revolutionize health care by making its data AI-ready. By
unifying their research data, they're accelerating drug discovery and clinical development to deliver life-saving
medicines to patients faster, working towards their ambitious goal of 20 new medicines by 2030. And State Street,
which manages 10% of the world's financial assets is using Snowflake AI and machine learning to uncover new
market insight that help financial institutions make better investment decisions.
As our AI offerings continue to scale at lightning speed, our core business continues to be incredibly strong. We
have talked a lot about delivering on our vision of being the end-to-end technology provider for our customers'
data journey. Already, we are introducing additional Snowflake connectors in private preview, leveraging the
technology from our acquisition of Datavolo to provide seamless connectivity and data integration.
With key platforms like SharePoint, Google Drive, Workday, Slack and many more, our customers are loving this
capability, and we have strengthened our foundation to deliver an extensible and flexible connectivity platform for
unstructured data as well as structured data.
As we continue to bring new innovations to market, we are focused on scaling efficiently. We are investing in the
growth of our go-to-market operations and maintaining our seamless collaboration between engineering, product,
marketing, and sales to bring products to market effectively, delivering more value to existing customers as well
as winning new ones.
Using our Cortex AI technology, our GTM teams can now quickly discover the most relevant sales content by
asking natural language questions of our sales knowledge assistant. And with our [ph] fast stream with us (11:32),
they can get deep insight into our customers' consumption trends in our Customer 360 app.
You'll also see our emphasis on rigor and efficiency in our growth plan. Our head count growth over the next year
is focused on engineering and sales, which are teams with direct impact to revenue. We are using AI internally to
drive efficiency in incredible rates. Our teams are able to tap into a wealth of data and information faster than ever
before. It is this operational rigor that we instituted in fiscal 2025 that is now our way of life going forward,
investing in growth while having a maniacal focus on driving efficiency throughout our business.
Mike, why don't you take us through more of the financial details?

Michael P. Scarpelli
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Thank you, Sridhar. In FY 2025, product revenue grew 30% year-over-year to reach $3.5 billion. Our core
business is strong. We continue to see stable consumption patterns as evidenced by our 126% net revenue
retention rate. New products are becoming an important growth driver. Snowpark contributed 3% of FY 2025
product revenue and we are seeing strong adoption of our new data engineering and AI features. In Q4,

Q4 2025 Earnings Call 26-Feb-2025
technology customers outperformed while financial services continues to be our top vertical. EMEA was another
source of strength.
The Q4 holiday impact was consistent with our expectations. Remaining performance obligations grew 33% year-
over-year. During the quarter, several large customers ran out of capacity before their contract end date, as their
revenue outpaced their contracted bookings. And so, instead of pulling forward their renewal cycle, these
accounts are now purchasing as they consume. This is common for large customers, and we do not view this
choice as indicative of their future consumption patterns.
Turning to margin. FY 2025 non-GAAP product gross margin of 76% landed in line with expectations. FY 2025
non-GAAP operating margin was 6%. Last quarter, we discussed our plans to improve efficiency. These efforts
include centralizing teams, targeted early career hiring, removing redundant management layers and continuous
performance management.
In Q4, these efforts yielded meaningful margin gains. Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of 9% outperformed
expectations. FY 2025 non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin of 26% landed in line with our expectations. In
FY 2025, we used $1.9 billion to repurchase 14.8 million shares at a weighted average share price of $130.87.
We did not make any repurchases in Q4. We still have $2 billion remaining on our authorization through March
2027, ended the year with $5.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments.
Moving to our outlook. We expect Q1 product revenue between $955 million and $960 million, representing 21%
to 22% year-over-year growth. As a reminder, Q1 is our most difficult year-over-year comparison, as we lap leap
year. We expect Q1 non-GAAP operating margin of 5%. This margin outlook includes expenses associated with
our annual sales kickoff event posted in Q1. We expect approximately $15 million in expenses similar to last year.
For FY 2026, we expect product revenue of approximately $4.28 billion, representing 24% year-over-year growth.
We are forecasting stable growth within our core business. We expect new product features to contribute to the
step-up in year-over-year growth rates in the second half of the year. As always, our forecast includes headwinds
associated with performance improvements. As I said last quarter, product improvements are an ongoing part of
our business, and we will not be breaking out assumptions for specific features moving forward.
Turning to margins, we expect non-GAAP product gross margin of approximately 75%. Longer term, we expect
easier GPU access and growing AI revenue to benefit product gross margins associated with new product
features. Non-GAAP operating margin will expand to reach 8% for the year. We expect non-GAAP adjusted free
cash flow margin of 25% for the year.
Our strong revenue growth, combined with a more thoughtful approach to hiring, and increased leverage from AI
will benefit stock-based compensation as a percent of revenue. In FY 2026, we expect SBC as a percent of
revenue to decrease to approximately 37% from 41% and will continue to decrease year-on-year.
We will be hosting our Investor Day in conjunction with our Summit Conference the week of June 2 in San
Francisco. If you are interested in attending, please e-mail ir@snowflake.com. Before opening up the line for
questions, you've likely seen our filing sharing that I plan to retire once a successor is in place and up to speed.
The company executed well in FY 2025, under the new leadership of Sridhar and I feel we are set up for success
in 2026 and beyond. This is the right time to hand the reins over to a new CFO. The company will be kicking off a
search for my replacement, and I will stay on board full time until a suitable replacement is in place and the
transition is completed.

Sridhar Ramaswamy
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Mike, before we jump into Q&A, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude. Over the past year, you've been
an incredible partner. And I'm deeply appreciative that you will continue to be as we work together to make this a
smooth transition.
Snowflake wouldn't be the iconic company it is today without your years of leadership. And I know I speak on
behalf of all of our employees when I say, we are so happy for you, and we look forward to celebrating you [ph]
over the coming (18:12).
We can now open up the line for questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your
line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjit K. Singh Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thank you. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith. I want to extend my congrats. Not many software companies at scale
are growing 30% in this environment. And then, Mike, congrats on stellar distinctive career in software.
With that, maybe just some of the questions, maybe Mike to start with you, on your comment on these large
customers in Q4 exhausting their commitments but not necessarily renewing, going on demand. How usual or
unusual is that? And do you expect these customers just to sign a kind of contract in due course?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah, I fully expect they're going to sign a new commitment. But as you know, we typically sign a three-year
contract with our customers once they're up and running. Many new customers started one year the first year then
go to three years. And under their contract, they make a capacity commitment to us based on what they expect
they're going to go through. But if they burn through that commitment before the end of the contract term, the
customer has two options. They can do an early renewal and make a new capacity purchase. Typically, they only
do that if they're going to get some economics for that, that makes sense to them, or they continue to purchase
under the same terms as they go to the end of their contract period, at which time they must do a new capacity
purchase of equal to or greater than, to get the same economics that they have in their contract.
So this has always happened. We just had a few big customers that, that happened to in this quarter, and I fully
expect sometime over the next month to six months that those people will sign new contracts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
And I'll just add on a couple of obvious statement, which is that these customers reaching their capacity earlier is
a good thing. It means that their consumption has gone over what they predicted at the beginning of the contract.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call 26-Feb-2025
Generally speaking, these accounts are in a pretty happy place. And yes, there's sometimes a little movement
here and there with timing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjit K. Singh Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. That makes complete sense. And then Sridhar maybe for you, Mike also sort of tying the guidance with the
new products probably shows the more muster in the second half of this year. You've done a lot of work. The
team has done a lot of work accelerating the pace of product innovation. Could you give us some color on the
adoption trends within the data engineering portfolio and showing one bucket?
And then looking at sort of the AI/ML application platform side with some of the announcements supporting both
OpenAI models and Anthropic models, when do you think that starts to unlock more of the workloads, more
customer adoption and ultimately, a greater revenue as we look to the balance of this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah, that's a great question. And in areas like data engineering, as you know, we've been working on
technologies like Snowpark, which is our version of ARC. And we have talked about how that has already driven
robust adoption. I think what is new in the world of open data is what all of like the technologies that we are
bringing allows us to do in this like vastly expanded scope of data that is available to us. And we are increasing
that by making investments in companies like Datavolo and turning that into a large set of connectors that can
bring in more data.
And both Christian and I and the sales team track these different areas. We have talked to you previously about
product features like dynamic tables. This truly is an amazing product where setting up complicated pipelines is
roughly as simple as writing a SQL query. So we are seeing a lot of brisk adoption, and it can also reach scale
very quickly because it feeds very naturally into large-scale applications. So both Christian and I and others are
very confident on that side.
AI is interesting in the sense that, it is a much newer set of products, generally speaking, throughout the world,
not just at Snowflake. We are seeing broad adoption of AI. The way we approached it, which is to build rock solid
primitives. Our Search product, for example, is among the best in the world. We published a benchmark recently
showing how it was in the top three.
And so products like that have a lot of potential but you'll also see a multiplicative effect. The more the great
connectors that you have in portfolio, the more data can be brought in for applications like Search. In turn, they
will drive other applications that our customers or our partners can build on top of Snowflake. For example, let's
say, like an insurance underwriting application or like a legal analysis kind of application, more and more of those
kinds of things become possible with the combination of data engineering and AI technologies.
We have seen broad adoption of AI. We expect that to turn into real revenue over the coming quarters. But the
point that I want to make is that, all of these fit together seamlessly. The more we can do with ingestion, the more
options there are for us to do meaningful things to data engineering.
The more we can do with data engineering and support of formats like Iceberg, the easier it is for people to use
Snowflake for ad hoc analytics use cases on data that is sitting in cloud storage. And the more data that is sitting
and are accessible to Snowflake, the more value you can get out of products like Cortex Analyst and now

Snowflake Intelligence. So it is this tying in that I think is pretty unique to us. And yes, we expect these to
meaningfully contribute in the latter half of the year.

Kirk Materne Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Yeah. Thanks very much. Congrats on a great quarter. And Mike, congrats on a great run at Snowflake. Sridhar, I
don't know if it's for you or Christian, but over the last 6 to 12 months, we've seen a lot of new announcements
from data companies sort of partnering up with enterprise software vendors like ServiceNow or Salesforce and
you guys have partnered with them. One of your competitors just partner with partner with SAP. I guess what's
the best way to interpret these announcements in terms of where the center of gravity from a data perspective
lives? I was just wondering if you guys could comment on that.
And then, Mike, really quickly for you. Just any adjustments to the sales comp model that we should be aware of
this year? Thanks very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Why don't you go first, Mike, on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah, on the comp model, probably the biggest change is taking a little bit of a step-back in terms of allocation.
We're still principally paying people on their variable comp on revenue. But we do think it's important that reps
also have a total contract bookings number as well too. And so there's going to be a quota as well on bookings,
but the bulk of their earnings will come from consumption revenue.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Great. And going back to the first question, we call ourselves the AI data cloud for a good reason. This is because
most customers see us as the best place to get value from data, especially analytic and predictive value from
data.
At Snowflake itself, for example, we have connectors that bring in data from Salesforce, from ServiceNow, from
GitHub and the list sort of goes on and on. And I think what's obviously been very interesting for all of us, even
prior to the AI revolution, is being able to look at this data, say Workday data as well as Snowflake data along with
Salesforce data all in the same pane. All of us have access to reports that can stitch these kinds of data together.
And so we have done a number of partnerships with many companies, some of our best ones are with folks like
ServiceNow and Salesforce. We have bidirectional integrations with them, where a lot of customers bring data
from those applications into Snowflake. It works very, very smoothly.

I think what is unique in the world of Agentic AI is the time to value from data can become exceptionally quick
because you're not in the process of building painful integrations, painful new applications. And some of the things
we ourselves, again, have been able to build with Snowflake Intelligence have been pretty remarkable. We do
expect this trend to continue. Of course, players like ServiceNow, or Salesforce, or SAP, they're going to have a
class of applications, which can benefit from data that is coming from outside. And hence, we do bidirectional
partnership.
The larger theme that I would point to in both of this is that of giving customers choice. Customers should have
the right to decide where it is that their data should be. And as far as we are concerned, I think we are very
uniquely positioned as a central and very efficient repository of data for most companies. And yes, some of our
customers will take data over to one of the folks that I mentioned. SAP, in particular, Christian will give us an
update.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Kleinerman A
Executive Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc.
Yes. So, as Sridhar said, we've always done bidirectional type of sharing and data movement with a number of
partners. While we don't have a specific announcement to share SAP today, I can tell you that we are working
with SAP. We like what they're doing with the business data cloud products. And we have a common commitment
to foster an open data environment and hope to share more with all of you soon.

Raimo Lenschow Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Perfect. Thank you. Congrats from my end for the quarter and for Mike as well. It was an honor working with you
over the last few years. Two questions. One for Sridhar, one for Mike. Sridhar, how do we think about adjacencies
for your offering that you kind of might want to consider? Or how do you think about them? Like, for example, this
quarter there was a big debate about streaming and how that might fit into you. So, maybe can you kind of talk
about like how you see the product evolving from your perspective?
And then, Mike, for you on guidance, how conservative are the assumptions this year in the guidance versus kind
of what you – for example, this last year when you had the CEO change, obviously how did the economy also
play into the guidance for this year? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A

It's just more, if you think about adjacencies for where you want to play versus where you want to partner, and
there think about streaming, for example, as one of the kind of areas?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. Like overall, we work with a number of partners. The data space is a very large space. We try to be very
open and clear with our partners about where our big areas of investment are. And absolutely, we work with a
number of folks in streaming. But both streaming and ingestion are areas where we think it is important for us to
have a good offering in place.
And while it looks simple, streaming comes in many shapes and sizes. There are on-prem solutions that are
great. There are more cloud-native sort of solutions and the same goes for connectors. We will have a robust
ingestion offering, and we continue to work with partners. We do continue – we do think of streaming as a critical
area for Snowflake, just like we think of Snowflake Intelligence, which begins to merge the line between what one
would think of as BI and a new class of application. It's literally – it's a new thing. We think it's important for us to
have a presence there.
Christian, any thoughts to add?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Kleinerman A
Executive Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc.
No. We, at the same time, partner with a number of players. We continue [indiscernible] (32:25) partners. We
have lots of customers that uses alongside other technologies, you may be alluding to Redpanda, but with also
companies like Confluent are great partners, and we will continue to do that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A

And then, Raimo, on your question of guidance, I'm just going to say the guidance I feel is appropriate. We've
always tried to get meaningful guidance. And given the scale we're at right now, we think a 3% beat should be
considered a big beat. And I feel good about the guidance that we've set for the quarter and the year. And by the
way, everyone makes it sound like this is my last call. I think I'll be here for a little while longer [indiscernible]

Great. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Maybe first for Sridhar. With Cortex Agents announced for
agent orchestration, can you talk a little bit more about what differentiates your offering versus many other agent
offerings out there and maybe where the product vision came from? Was this something customers were asking
for? And are there any early adopters maybe that you're working with out there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
It's a good question. I think the best answer to that goes back to something that I talked about earlier in the
context of the data cloud. I think we are rapidly approaching a world in which data is even more central than
before. Previously, if you had data sets and wanted to stitch them together and/or build an application, you had to
painfully engineer semantics, figure out how to do it, build an application and then figure out how to write – for
example, how to use an API to write back data.
What for example [ph] Cloud (34:30) does incredibly well is, it can produce pretty professional-grade UI with
instructions in English, which was just like unthinkable a couple of years ago. I think it is that centrality of data that
plays into how we think about agent flows. When other software vendor talk about agentic applications, they are
generally limited to the context of the particular function that they serve. So for example, if you have a customer
service offering, then you will naturally offer a customer service agent that can automate parts of the work that,
that agent is going to do.
We are uniquely positioned in that – we are a horizontal platform. Customers store all different kinds of data with
us. And that makes it possible to create pretty interesting new applications. It's too early for me to speak in public
about customers and use cases just yet. But I can give you lots of examples even within Snowflake, where the
ability to look at data that is sitting in Salesforce, which is where all our meeting data lives and simultaneously
look at all of our enablement material are notes from each of the use cases. And then using that to update some
stores, update the status of things. This is an application that we're super excited about.
It is this combination of structured data, unstructured data, tool calling that are the basic ingredients. And we can
also scale these very effectively with a number of partners that we have, companies like Elementum build on top
of Snowflake and they're going to use the core infrastructure that we provide to drive these kinds of agent
applications.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Zelnick Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
That's really helpful. Thank you, Sridhar. And Mike, just for you, with Q4 being such a bonanza bookings quarter,
where you do a lot of big deals with large customers, can you talk more about the trends you're seeing with your
largest customers, maybe the momentum and expansion rates and the services that they're embracing and plan
to consume this year? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. I'll just say the momentum continues with the large customers. They continue to grow and consume like
any quarter, some overachieve our forecast. Some are under. There was nothing usual there. But large
customers really are the ones that drive our revenue growth. I was very pleased with the number of million-dollar
plus customers growing in the number of $5 million and $10 million as well, too. So I'm very pleased there.

And I think our sales organization has really built up a lot of muscle too, this year to really identify new workload
opportunities and go live. I think our professional services and our partners are getting better at migrations and
handling a number of these things as well, too. I think our SE organization has really stepped up and is going to
really help drive a lot of those new workloads next year in Snowflake. So I'm very pleased with what I'm seeing
right now.

Brent A. Bracelin Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good afternoon. Mike, happy to learn you're not leaving anytime soon here. We'll save the congrats. But I did
want to ask you a question around product growth. The guide implies an acceleration for the first time into the
second half in three-and-a-half years. What's driving the optimism on acceleration? Is it all new products? Or are
you feeling better about consumption activity across the base?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
It's both. The core of our business is very strong, coupled with the new products that we see that will be going into
production. Also on top of, I'm pleased with the muscle we've been building on new customer acquisitions, and
that's going to start to kick-in, in the second half of the year.
We do get a lot of visibility into our existing customers with planned migrations that they have. And I think that is
looking very good for the second half of the year. And remember, our guidance for Q1 seems low, but that is
because of the -- that we miss one business day because of leap year, and that's a fair chunk revenue that comes
out of that, when you're looking at that growth rate just in Q1.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brent A. Bracelin Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Helpful color there. And then Sridhar, just as you think about growth levers to the business, one area you flagged
with this idea of Snowflake's role in AI-powered advertising. You clearly know the advertising market well. I never
really thought of the large ad market as a meaningful opportunity for Snowflake. Can you just double click into
when you think about the AI-powered ad market, is there an unlock that you see there for Snowflake in that kind
of new workload scenario? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
We've actually been in this area in the area of marketing and advertising for a fairly long time. There are tons of
CDP, start-ups others that, custom CDPs that people build, customer data platforms on top of Snowflake. In fact,
we acquired a company called Samooha, because data clean rooms are a really powerful, enabling technology
for things like conversion lift. And part of what we facilitate in this role like a ecosystem player is automating even
more operations.

We talked last time about this idea called AI SQL, which is what are the primitives you can put into SQL such as
that image analysis, video analysis can be done very easily by analysts, so you can ask questions like does
putting a Christmas tree into the ad increase the click-through or the conversion rate of an ad that you show over
the holidays.
And so I think like as we introduce multimodal capabilities into Cortex, I think the lens of what is achievable with
Snowflake will continue to expand. And of course, with language models, with AI models in general, the
generative applications, how can you generate creative. How can you generate copy for creators?
Those are also areas that become easier and easier to do. And so that's our broad role. It's an important vertical,
both marketing and advertising for Snowflake. But I think the arc is moving more from measurement and privacy-
preserving technologies to also generative technologies that can power more automated testing, and like things
like auto-AI measurement using Snowflake.

Sridhar, maybe just on looking at the spend intensity in your market, it seems like something has changed to the
positive over the past six months. It seems like it's gotten better. You've been meeting with a lot of customers.
Mike mentioned the tech and financial services verticals outperforming. But maybe can you talk to how much of
this is a broader demand environment versus sales execution improvements versus confidence in kind of like
better product innovation velocity, releasing of new products? Anything you can do there, I think it would be
helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Well, you know how this works. Positive feedback cycles like feed on themselves. And but I would say, in my
mind, the pretty substantial changes that we have made in how we operate as a company, absolutely. First is
around product velocity. I think if you look at the pace of how we've been able to get AI products out to market, I
think it's been remarkable.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call 26-Feb-2025
But there's a lot more innovation that is happening. We have a big effort around AI-powered migrations that you
will hear more about. We have invested heavily in data collaboration and sharing with release of things like an
internal marketplace for our data, lots of new products in the data engineering space, including Iceberg.
So from that perspective, I think we are just feeling more confident about who we are and obviously, expanding
the approach here of what is possible. Previously, it used to be that people would have to bring their data into
Snowflake to get something done. But the things like Iceberg, we can take care of that right off the bat without any
need for movement. I think product velocity is one part. But to what Mike was talking about, I think there is an
awareness of the use case life cycle, of the discipline needed to understand where we can create value for our
customers, map it out in a thoughtful way and then engage in a fairly, I would say, constant or constant
conversation about what are the best places our account teams and our customers can come to a shared
understanding of the projects that we should be working on. And I think that area is becoming more and more of a
science where we are able to what the best people and the team do and have more folks to be more like them. I
think there's just a maturity when it comes to use case prosecution.
I think the third piece, which is what gives us confidence about new products is then how all of these come
together in how things are multiplexed over from the product team to the sales team. I mean at the end of the day,
it's unreasonable for Christian or I to expect that one salesperson is going to know about the 400 things that we
launched last year, is just not a thing. And so we increasingly have specialist teams that know what it is to take,
for example, clean rooms to the two dozen most important customers that they must reach this year, say,
compared to pretty much all of our customers who we think can benefit from key data engineering features or key
AI features. I think it is that maturity and the ability to take the right feature to the right customer to create value
that I think positions us overall better.
And the final thing that I'll add on here is that we've also cleaned up how we work with partners, definitely ISVs,
but also system integrators. And I think you will see more progress on that side as well. So we are very proud that
our ISV partners like RelationalAI, or Qumu are, of course – Blue Yonder with whom we have a fairly deep
partnership, are succeeding along with Snowflake. So it's a multifaceted effort, but they build on the same core
perimeters of great product, a sales team that knows how to execute at scale and ability to thoughtfully overlay
new things that we should be doing on what is a very large sales force.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alex Zukin Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Super helpful and really clear. Mike, maybe one for you while we still have you. The guide for next year, it does
seem like it's starting – I think you've gotten this question a few different ways. It's starting at a stronger place than
if I look a year ago, if we look a year ago, when you were incorporating maybe some Iceberg risk. So to the extent
that you can put a finer point on that confidence that you have to put that guide out there, again, implying some
acceleration. You mentioned some or Sridhar mentioned some new products potentially ramping in the second
half from a contribution standpoint. How do we think about Iceberg as a tailwind or a headwind in that guide? How
do we think about NRR stabilization at 126% in the context of that guide? Any finer points you'd put on it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. First of all, I think NRR is pretty stable. I'm not saying it's not going to go to 125% or 124%, but I don't really
see it. It's going to be in the mid-120s is what we are predicting. In terms of Iceberg, we're really now seeing
iceberg as more of a tailwind than a headwind, as it's opening up so much more data for us. We've yet to see
massive amounts of data move out of Snowflake. Yes, there has been some, but storage still remains at roughly

11% of our revenue. And we are seeing workloads that otherwise wouldn't have been accessible to Snowflake.
So, I think that's good.
And our guide is based upon the strength of what we're seeing with customer commitments. And as I said before,
we've done a really good job this year. There's still room for improvement always and there will always be room
for improvement. But I think we're getting much better at working with customers to identify new workloads that
will go into production that gives us that confidence.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Just to add on what Mike said, which is – I've said this before, the Iceberg story is one that Snowflake can write.
We've made all the right investments in the format, how broadly it is getting adopted. And yes, while there will be
some customers who might want to move data that is in Snowflake over to iceberg, there is vastly more
opportunity for us to take Snowflake to where the data is.
And that's what I mean when I say, this is our history to write. And that's what we are in the process of doing. We
have had success with a number of data engineering use cases. We think that there are a lot of data analytics
use cases to also go after, and that's the exciting opportunity that has opened up for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Kleinerman A
Executive Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc.
And I'll add that I think on Iceberg, we've shifted from theoretical to actual consumption, actual revenue coming
already materializing to us.

interesting. I think we are definitely headed to a world in which there are now several players. It's not two any
longer that are leading the charge when it comes to the world's innovation with AI. And the fact that it is a healthy
combination of open-source models as well as proprietary models, we think is a good thing.
As I said, our value comes from our customers being able to bring all of their data together into one place and
derive more and more value with it. And what our partnerships with the leading model makers of the world
indicates is an implicit acknowledgment that we have a big role to play in this world of AI.
And so, what we are doing is building the best products that can take advantage of the data gravity that we have
and access to the biggest, best models that there are on the planet. Absolutely. I think there is a belief on the part

of billions of dollars. I mean, sadly or not, that's not us. But I feel very happy about our ability to work with these

Hey. Thanks for taking my question. This is Matt Martino on for Kash Rangan. Sridhar, one for you. I know
Snowflake is recently coming off their Sales Kickoff. So it would just be great to get some of your takeaways from
the event and kind of what the key message was to the sales force, whether it's around prosecuting new use
cases or pushing some of the newer products Snowflake is bringing to market? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
As you folks know, Sales Kickoff is about unifying around a common message, a common theme, a sense of
purpose. I think I found the enthusiasm among the folks to be infectious. I think it was very good. I can't obviously
attend like all of the meetings. They're all in parallel.
But I looked at some of the material, I think the level of sophistication that our leaders are bringing to how they
take care of business where they find out what do exemplary SEs do and how do we hold them as a role model
for others and how we thoughtfully add on new products.
As I said, we are at a place where it's pretty unreasonable for anyone to expect that they're going to know
everything that Snowflake does. So, we've introduced things like colleges. These are essentially constructs within
Snowflake for specialization in different areas. So that somebody that wants to become an expert in machine
learning within a particular pod, can sign up, become that expert and serve as a point of contact for that particular
pod.

Operator: Thank you for your question. Final question is from the line of Joel Fishbein with Truist Securities.
Your line is now open.

Joel P. Fishbein, Jr. Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Thanks for taking the question. I guess it's a two-part. One for Sridhar and one for Mike, but same topic. You had
an expansion with your partnership with Microsoft and relates to OpenAI. I would love to just get a little more
granular about what that means for you guys for Snowflake? And Mike, if you can potentially quantify what that
could mean from a revenue standpoint in the future? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
I'll start, and Christian should add. We have a broad and deep partnership with Microsoft, at the level of data, but
also products where things that we create come out in Microsoft Copilot, come out in Teams. And so I'm very
happy with that partnership. We are increasingly going to market together in a number of situations. And so I think
that is all hugely positive. What the specifics of this partnership means is that OpenAI models that effectively
accessible within Snowflake security perimeter. And that's a highly technical definition. It is basically the
guarantee that we make to our customers that their data is fully under our control. It's a big deal for our
customers. I think what this means in practice is that every product that we make starting with simply having the
model available in a model garden that we have, I use Anthropic all the time in one of our internal instances, that
ability to have access to these world-class models to then build different kinds of chatbot, different kinds of
Agentic applications.
And so what this enables is for us and our customers, is to be able to build world-class applications without
having to have data go anywhere else, without special licenses that are needed. It just means that like OpenAI
models are available out of the box just like on Anthropic models are available on AWS out of the box. So I think
this is a pretty big deal for a lot of our customers. Color on the overall partnership – you're good, okay

Michael P. Scarpelli A

Yeah. And I'll just say, Joel, from a what is that impact going to be on our business. Obviously, we wouldn't do it if
we didn't think it could be impactful to our business, but it's too early to say. And I would say that would be upside
in our revenue once we see traction with that. But it's going to take some time before we get this rolled out to
customers.

back to Sridhar for any closing remarks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Thank you. In closing, I think Snowflake stands to benefit enormously from the data and AI revolution that is
sweeping the enterprise market. Our philosophy of an easy-to-use, fast to value efficient product makes us
uniquely differentiated and much loved by our customers.
30% product revenue growth in fiscal 2025 combined with our strong initial outlook for fiscal 2026 I think
demonstrates our ability to execute at scale. And so we are going to continue our strategy of driving high growth
and efficiency. Our ability to release products and take them to market quickly is what enables high growth.
Simultaneously, generating more than $1 billion of adjusted free cash flow, expanding operating margin and
increasing SBC efficiency further demonstrate the strength of the business.
I think the long-term profile of Snowflake is one that showcases durable growth and continued margin expansion,
which I think is very unique. And this is really exciting, and I look forward to sharing more and more of our
progress with all of you along the way. Thank you all for joining us.

Sundar Pichai
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Thank you, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. This was a terrific quarter for Alphabet,
driven by double-digit growth across every major part of our business. We are seeing AI now driving real business
results across the company. We delivered our first ever $100 billion quarter.
Five years ago, our quarterly revenue was at $50 billion. Our revenue number has doubled since then, and we
are firmly in the generative AI era. In parallel, we've built for the long-term and diversified with successful
businesses in cloud, YouTube and subscriptions. Our momentum is strong, and we are shipping at speed.
As just a few examples: Our first-party models like Gemini, now process 7 billion tokens per minute via direct API
use by our customers. The Gemini app now has over 650 million monthly active users and queries increased by
3x from Q2.
Cloud had another great quarter of accelerating growth with AI revenue as a key driver. Cloud backlog grew 46%
quarter-over-quarter to $155 billion. And we crossed $300 million paid subscriptions led by growth in Google One
and YouTube Premium.
Today, I'll discuss progress in our full stack approach to AI and then share highlights from Search, Cloud,
YouTube and Waymo. As a reminder, our full stack approach spans AI infrastructure, world-class research,
including models and tooling and our products and platforms that bring AI to people everywhere.
First up, AI infrastructure. Our extensive and reliable infrastructure, which powers all of Google's products is the
foundation of our stack and a key differentiator. We are scaling the most advanced chips in our data centers,
including GPUs from our partner, NVIDIA as well as our own purposeful TPUs. And we are the only company
providing a wide range of both.
As we announced yesterday at NVIDIA GTC, we are now shipping the new A4X Max instances powered by
NVIDIA GB300 to our cloud customers. Our highly sought-after TPU portfolio is led by our seventh generation
TPU Ironwood, which will be generally available soon. We are investing in TPU capacity to meet the tremendous
demand we are seeing from customers and partners, and we are excited that Anthropic recently shared plans to
access up to 1 million TPUs.
Next world-class AI research, including models and tooling. Our models are world-leading. Gemini 2.5 Pro, Veo,
Genie 3 and our viral sensation, Nano Banana, are among the very best in class. Over 230 million videos have
been generated with Veo 3, and more than 13 million developers have built with our generative models. We're
looking forward to the release of Gemini 3 later this year.
Our research leadership is advancing next-frontier technologies. Last week, we announced that our Willow
quantum chip achieved a major breakthrough, running an algorithm 13,000 times faster than one of the world's
best supercomputers. And the result is verifiable, paving the way to future practical applications.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2025
Speaking of quantum, let me congratulate Michel Devoret, our chief scientist for quantum hardware. He received
a Nobel in Physics for early research he did in the 1980s. Three Nobels awarded to current Googlers in two
years, incredible.
And third, our products and platforms, we're bringing AI to more people and developers than anyone else. In July,
we announced that we processed 980 trillion monthly tokens across all our surfaces. We are now processing over
1.3 quadrillion monthly tokens, more than 20x growth in a year; phenomenal. This quarter we took big steps to
reimagine Chrome as a browser powered by AI through deep integrations with Gemini and AI Mode in Search,
with more agentic capabilities coming soon.
In August, at Made by Google, we unveiled our Pixel 10 series of devices. They're the first with our most powerful
chip designed to run on Gemini, Tensor G5. They're our best-reviewed devices ever. And last week we launched
Android XR, our new operating system, with Samsung's Galaxy XR device. It brings new ways to use headsets
and glasses with Gemini at the core.
Now turning to highlights from Search. AI is driving an expansionary moment for Search. As people learn what
they can do with our new AI experiences, they are increasingly coming back to Search more. Search and its AI
experiences are built to highlight the web, sending billions of clicks to sites every day.
During the Q2 call we shared that overall queries and commercial queries continued to grow year-over-year. This
growth rate increased in Q3, largely driven by our AI investments in Search, most notably AI Overviews and AI
Mode. Let me dive into the momentum we are seeing.
As we've shared before, AI Overviews drive meaningful query growth. This effect was even stronger in Q3, as
users continued to learn that Google can answer more of their questions. And it's particularly encouraging to see
the effect was more pronounced with younger people.
We're also seeing that AI Mode is resonating well with users. In the US, we've seen strong and consistent week-
over-week growth in usage since launch and queries doubled over the quarter. Over the last quarter, we rolled out
AI Mode globally across 40 languages in record time. It now has over 75 million daily active users. And we
shipped over 100 improvements to the product in Q3, an incredibly fast pace. Most importantly, AI Mode is
already driving incremental total query growth for Search. Philipp will talk more about monetization and share how
AI is helping people connect with businesses and shop on Search.
Next, Google Cloud. Our complete enterprise AI product portfolio is accelerating growth in revenue, operating
margins and backlog. In Q3, customer demand strengthened in three ways. One, we are signing new customers
faster. The number of new GCP customers increased by nearly 34% year-over-year. Two, we are signing larger
deals. We have signed more deals over $1 billion through Q3 this year than we did in the previous two years
combined. Third, we are deepening our relationships. Over 70% of existing Google Cloud customers use our AI
products, including Banco BV, Best Buy and FairPrice Group. As we scale, we are diversifying revenue. Today,
13 product lines are each at an annual run rate over $1 billion. And we are improving operating margin with highly
differentiated products built with our own technology.
This deep product differentiation starts with our AI infrastructure. We have a decade of experience building AI
accelerators and today offer the widest array of chips. This leadership is winning customers like HCA Healthcare,
LG AI Research and Macquarie Bank, and it's why nine of the top 10 AI labs choose Google Cloud.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2025
We are also the only Cloud provider offering our own leading generative AI models, including Gemini, Imagen,
Veo, Chirp and Lyria. Adoption is rapidly accelerating. In Q3, revenue from products built on our generative AI
models grew more than 200% year-over-year.
Over the past 12 months, nearly 150 Google Cloud customers each processed approximately 1 trillion tokens with
our models for a wide range of applications. For example, WPP is creating campaigns with up to 70% efficiency
gains, Swarovski has increased email open rates by 17% and accelerated campaign localization by 10 times.
Earlier this month, we launched Gemini Enterprise, the new front door for AI in the workplace, and we're seeing
strong adoption for agents built on this platform. Our packaged enterprise agents in Gemini Enterprise are
optimized for a variety of domains, are highly differentiated, and offer significant out-of-box value to customers.
We have already crossed 2 million subscribers across 700 companies.
Next, YouTube. In the living room, YouTube has remained number one in streaming watch time in the US for
more than two years, according to Nielsen. Last month marked YouTube's first time as a live NFL broadcaster.
This exclusive global broadcast, live from Brazil, drew more than 19 million fans, and set a new record for most
concurrent viewers of a live stream on YouTube.
YouTube Shorts also continues to perform well. In the US, Shorts now earn more revenue per watch hour than
traditional in-stream on YouTube. At our Made on YouTube event, we rolled out a number of AI-powered features
that are helping creators supercharge creation and build their businesses. AI is now streamlining the entire
content creation workflow, from generative video tools and more efficient editing to AI-powered insights that help
creators optimize their channels. We're also using AI to expand monetization, automatically identifying products to
make their videos more shoppable. Philipp will discuss in more detail.
And finally, Waymo. Next year, Waymo aims to open service in London, and they're working to bring service to
Tokyo. They've also announced expansions to Dallas, Nashville, Denver and Seattle, and secured permission to
operate fully autonomously at San Jose and San Francisco airports. Autonomous testing continues to scale in
New York City.
The new Waymo for Business allows enterprises to offer Waymo as a work travel option. And we launched
Waymo Teens accounts in Phoenix this summer. We're pleased to see usage steadily increase, with positive
feedback from teens and their parents alike. Waymo's growth and momentum are strong, and 2026 is shaping up
to be an exciting year.
Overall, a milestone quarter. The incredible work of our teams is driving momentum across the board, and our
leadership in AI positions us so well for the opportunity ahead. I want to thank all of our partners and our
employees for their hard work and an excellent Q3.
With that, I'll turn it over to Philipp.

Philipp Schindler
Chief Business Officer & Senior Vice President, Google LLC
Thanks, Sundar, and hello everyone. I'll quickly cover performance for Google Services for the quarter, then
structure the rest of my remarks around the great progress we're delivering across Search, Ads, YouTube and
partnerships.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2025
Google Services revenues were $87 billion for the quarter, up 14% year-on-year, driven by accelerated growth in
Search and YouTube, partially offset by year-on-year decline in network revenues. Adding some further color to
our results. The 15% increase in Search & other was led by growth across all major verticals with the largest
contributions from retail and financial services.
YouTube saw similar performance across verticals. Its 15% growth in advertising revenues was driven by direct
response followed by brand, starting with Search & other revenues which delivered over $56 billion in revenue for
the quarter. As Sundar mentioned, AI is driving an expansionary moment and transforming how people use
Google Search. Our investments in new AI experiences, such as AI Overviews and AI Mode continue to drive
growth in overall queries, including commercial queries, creating more opportunities for monetization.
These AI experiences are enhancing how people connect with businesses and shop on Search. We recently
added shopping capabilities in AI Mode, which now help people shop conversationally in Search and we
expanded try-on capabilities to more clothing items now available to anyone in the US.
Lastly, we're making it easier for consumers to benefit from deals through new loyalty offerings like personalized
annotations on organic results and ads. Looking at monetization, businesses can now tap into our most powerful
AI Search experiences. Using our most advanced AI models, we can understand and predict intent like never
before, unlocking entirely new commercial pathways to provide valuable new consumer connections and helping
us monetize even more efficiently. Rolled out globally in September, AI Max in Search is already used by
hundreds of thousands of advertisers currently making it the fastest-growing AI-powered Search Ads product.
In Q3 alone, AI Max unlocked billions of net new queries by delivering the most relevant ad across surfaces and
matching advertisers against additional queries they weren't reaching before. AI Max helps advertisers discover
new customers at the exact moment they need their product or service.
Kayak, for example, look to grow conversions while staying within their ROAS goals. After turning on AI Max in
Search, they grew the conversion value by 12% in early tests. We continue to infuse generative AI capabilities at
every step of the marketing process.
We rolled out Imagen 4 in Asset Studio and Product Studio, helping businesses produce more and better
creatives. On the measurement front, we enriched the model supporting Meridian, our marketing mix model, with
additional variables; and more granular reporting in PMax is making bidding more effective. A financial services
company so far has been using PMax to meet its ambitious growth targets and help drive a 39% improvement in
its conversion volume year-over-year.
Moving to YouTube, where we saw accelerated revenue growth. Our recommendation systems are driving robust
watch time growth in our key monetization areas like Shorts and Living Room. As we leverage Gemini models,
we're seeing further discovery improvement.
On direct response, we're excited about the growth in revenue we're seeing, especially from small and medium
advertisers adopting Demand Gen. We also improved performance on Demand Gen with over 100 launches
helping to increase conversion value by more than 40% for advertisers using target-based bidding on YouTube.
The retail vertical continues to lead our growth on YouTube with Demand Gen helping us further monetize
shopping-related categories.
Looking at the Living Room, our long-term bet, more advertisers are adopting interactive direct response ads,
leading to an annual revenue run rate exceeding $1 billion globally for this format. For our viewers, we continue to

give fans greater access across sports, while tapping into the best of YouTube's product innovation and creator-
led content.
Sundar mentioned that we expanded our NFL partnership with our first-ever exclusive global broadcast of an NFL
game. Brands love the opportunity and we sold all our ad inventory within a couple of weeks.
Looking at creators, a significant force behind the thriving YouTube creator economy is the collaboration between
creators and brands. Tools like direct linking to deals, websites and shorts and swappable brand segments in long
form will soon help creators show how they deliver great value for brands.
Thanks to a collaboration with Dude Perfect, Comcast Xfinity drove an 8% search lift, beating other Xfinity ads
recall lift on shorts by 34%. At the same time, it decreased the cost per lifted user by 50% when compared to the
next most efficient ad.
We continue to invest in AI-powered features that are helping creators supercharge creation and build their
businesses with Veo 3 integration and Speech to Song, creators go from idea to iteration quicker and new
channel insights help them better understand performance. Ending on YouTube with our subscriptions product,
we're also seeing momentum with strong growth in offerings such as YouTube Music and Premium and YouTube
TV.
We're also applying Gemini internally to help us serve customers with increased speed, intelligence and
efficiency. Our sales teams use Gemini enriched with ads knowledge to streamline customer interactions. This
increased productivity by over 10%, led to hundreds of millions in incremental revenue and frees up sellers to
engage with more customers at a deeper, more strategic level. In our Customer Support division, Gemini-
powered solutions have managed over 40 million customer sessions so far this year and resolved hundreds of
thousands of customer inquiries, and we're just getting started.
As always, I'll wrap with the progress we're seeing across partnerships where our customers tap into the strength
and breadth of Google's products to accelerate their transformation. Revolut, the global financial services
company, leverages Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform and Gemini models to help power its advanced customer
service chatbot, develop new hyper personalized financial products and offer predictive insights. Revolut is also
increasing its presence on YouTube adopting Veo 3 for personalized creatives, making Google a key ads partner
for delivering growth and launching new markets.
In closing, I'd like to thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions to our success. And as always, to our
customers and partners for their continued trust. And of course, a huge thanks to all of you as we celebrate 25
years of Google Ads.
Anat, over to you.

Thank you, Philipp. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I state
otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level and will then cover our segment results. I'll end with some
commentary on our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2025.
We had an outstanding quarter in Q3, continuing the strong momentum we've had throughout the year delivering
double-digit revenue growth across Search and YouTube Advertising, Subscriptions, Platforms & Devices and

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2025
Google Cloud. Consolidated revenue reached $102.3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase or 15% in constant
currency. Total cost of revenue was $41.4 billion, up 13%. TAC was $14.9 billion, up 8%.
Other cost of revenues was $26.5 billion, up 16%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition costs
largely for YouTube, followed by depreciation and other technical infrastructure operations costs.
Total operating expenses increased 28% to $29.7 billion, R&D expenses increased by 22%, driven by
compensation and depreciation expenses related to our AI efforts. Sales and marketing expenses were flat and
G&A expenses increased meaningfully, primarily due to a $3.5 billion charge related to the European Commission
fine mentioned in the earnings press release.
Operating income increased 9% this quarter to $31.2 billion, and operating margin was 30.5%. Excluding the EC
fine, operating income increased 22%, and operating margin was 33.9%. Operating margin benefited from strong
revenue growth and continued efficiencies in our expense base, offset by the legal charge and a significant
increase in depreciation expense.
Other income and expenses was $12.8 billion, primarily due to unrealized gains in our non-marketable equity
securities portfolio. Net income increased 33% to $35 billion and earnings per share increased 35% to $2.87. We
generated free cash flow of $24.5 billion in the third quarter and $73.6 billion for the trailing 12 months.
Free cash flow in Q3 benefited from strong operating cash flow and recent tax changes regarding the timing of
when research and development costs are expensed and assets are depreciated. This was partially offset by
higher CapEx. We ended the quarter with $98.5 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Turning to segment results, Google Services revenues increased 14% to $87.1 billion, reflecting strength in
Google Search, YouTube advertising and subscriptions. Google Search & other advertising revenues increased
by 15% to $56.6 billion representing another robust quarter with continued growth across all major verticals with
the largest contributions from retail and financial services.
YouTube advertising revenues increased 15% to $10.3 billion, driven by direct response advertising, followed by
brand. Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 3%. Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices
revenues increased 21% this quarter to $12.9 billion, driven by very strong growth in both YouTube and Google
One subscriptions.
Google Services' operating income increased 9% to $33.5 billion. Operating margin declined year-over-year to
38.5% as healthy revenue growth and continued efficiencies in our expense base were offset by the impact of the
EC fine, which was fully reflected in the Google Services segment.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment, which again delivered very strong results this quarter as Cloud continued
to benefit from our enterprise AI-optimized stack, including our own custom TPUs and our industry-leading, AI
models. Cloud revenue increased by 34% to $15.2 billion in the third quarter, driven by strong performance in
GCP, which continued to grow at a rate that was much higher than Cloud's overall revenue growth rate.
GCP's growth was driven by enterprise AI products, which are generating billions in quarterly revenue. We had
strong growth in enterprise AI infrastructure and enterprise AI solutions which benefited from demand for our
industry-leading models, including Gemini 2.5.

Core GCP was also a meaningful contributor to growth. And we had double-digit growth in Workspace, which was
driven by an increase in average revenues per seat and the number of seats. Cloud operating income increased
by 85% to $3.6 billion, and operating margin increased from 17.1% in the third quarter last year to 23.7% this
quarter.
The expansion in cloud operating margin was driven by strong revenue performance and continued efficiencies in
our expense base, partially offset by higher technical infrastructure usage costs, which includes depreciation
expense and other operations costs such as energy.
Google Cloud's backlog increased 46% sequentially and 82% year-over-year, reaching $155 billion at the end of
the third quarter. The increase was driven primarily by strong demand for enterprise AI. As Sundar mentioned
earlier, Cloud has signed more billion-dollar deals in the first nine months of 2025, than in the past two years
combined.
In Other Bets, revenues were $344 million, and operating loss was $1.4 billion in the third quarter. Within Other
Bets, we continue to allocate more resources to businesses like Waymo, where we see opportunities to create
substantial value.
With respect to CapEx, in the third quarter, our CapEx was $24 billion. The vast majority of our CapEx was
invested in technical infrastructure with approximately 60% of that investment in servers and 40% in data centers
and networking equipment. In Q3, we returned capital to shareholders through repurchases of stock of $11.5
billion and dividend payments of $2.5 billion.
Turning to our outlook, I would like to provide some commentary on factors that will impact our business
performance in the fourth quarter of 2025 as well as an updated outlook for CapEx for the year. First, in terms of
revenues, we're pleased with the overall momentum of our business. At the current spot rates, we could see an
FX tailwind to our revenues in Q4. However, the volatility in exchange rates could affect the impact of FX on Q4
revenues.
As for our segments in Google Services, year-over-year comparisons in advertising will be negatively impacted by
the strong spend on US elections in the fourth quarter of 2024, particularly on YouTube. In Cloud, demand for our
products remains high as evidenced by the accelerating revenue growth and the $49 billion sequential increase in
Cloud backlog in Q3. In GCP, we see strong demand for enterprise via infrastructure, including TPUs and GPUs,
enterprise AI solutions driven by demand for Gemini 2.5 and our other AI models and core GCP infrastructure and
other services such as cybersecurity and data analytics.
As I've mentioned on previous earnings calls, while we have been working hard to increase capacity and have
improved the pace of server deployments and data center construction, we still expect to remain in a tight
demand supply environment in Q4 and 2026.
Moving to investments. We're continuing to invest aggressively due to the demand we're experiencing from Cloud
customers as well as the growth opportunities we see across the company. We now expect CapEx to be in the
range of $91 billion to $93 billion in 2025, up from our previous estimate of $85 billion keeping in mind that the
timing of cash payments can cause variability in the reported CapEx number.
Looking out to 2026, we expect a significant increase in CapEx, and we'll provide more detail on our fourth quarter
earnings call. In terms of expenses, first, as I've mentioned on the previous earnings calls, the significant increase

in our investments in technical infrastructure will continue to put pressure on the P&L in the form of higher
depreciation expenses and related data center operations costs such as energy.
In the third quarter, depreciation increased $1.6 billion year-over-year to $5.6 billion, reflecting a growth rate of
41%. Given the overall increase in CapEx investments, we expect the growth rate in depreciation to accelerate
slightly in Q4.
Second, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the end of the year in part to
support product launches and the holiday season. Q3 was a strong quarter and we're excited with the adoption of
our AI products helped by a rapid pace of innovation and great execution by our teams. This translated into strong
momentum in Search, YouTube Ads, Subscription, Platforms & Devices, and Cloud, resulting in our first $100
billion plus quarter.
Now Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

Brian Nowak Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks for taking my questions everyone. The first one, maybe for Philipp or Sundar, it's on agentic e-
commerce and agentic travel. There's a lot of external Wall Street discussion about agentic e-commerce
potentially monetizing at a lower rate than Search. So, the question is, what factors are you most focused on to
sort of ensure a smooth transition for your Search business and for your advertisers as you move over to a more
agentic world?
And the second one, Sundar, is on Waymo. How far are we from an integration of Waymo into more of the core
Gemini capabilities and the users on the platform taking your user data of where I'm going, what hotel I'm staying
at, what airport I'm staying at and having integrated that into Waymo? If you can actually have users use their
profiles to pre-schedule Waymo. So, how far off is that? What do we have to do?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philipp Schindler A
Chief Business Officer & Senior Vice President, Google LLC
Hello, Brian, great question. This is all early, but we see agentic experiences really as additive to the way people
seek information. It helps us answer people's tough questions. It helps us – it helps people get stuff done, and it
helps businesses in the process. And we're working on multiple agentic experiences across key verticals such as
travel, commerce, shopping and so on. And we're paying a lot of attention to creating a seamless user
experience, but also to the fact that we need to integrate different partner ecosystems in a way that it creates
value for them.
And by the way, we're also working closely with a lot of our partners on the other side through our Cloud services
to improve their own agentic experiences. And so maybe we go a little deeper on the shopping side where we
actually use AI already very actively to improve the shopping experience.

As you know, we launched a more visual experience on AI Mode that gives people a much more intuitive
conversational way to shop. You can simply describe what you're looking for now like the way you talk to a friend,
and we'll show you the visual shopping results. And then we think about building an agentic shopping future and it
has to be one, again, that benefits both users and merchants here.
And you know that AI, we also introduced new agentic checkout, which will let shoppers use like agentic AI to buy
products from merchant sites and so on. We have a partnership with PayPal to help merchants build agentic
commerce experiences. We have new open protocols for agent to agent transactions and so on and so on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
And, Brian, on Waymo, a great question. I was reflecting, I think, on the exact same topic. I'm scheduled to meet
with the team to do a review on it in a few weeks out. Look, it is an exciting time. Waymo clearly is scaling up,
particularly in 2026. And I think the possibility, as you said, of Gemini, particularly with the multimodal experience,
as well as services like YouTube, I think there's a real opportunity to make the in-car experience dramatically
better. Definitely something we are excited about and you'll see newer experiences in 2026 for sure.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Doug Anmuth Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions. Philipp, maybe you can just talk more about some of the drivers of the core
Search strength. And I guess, in particular, when you think about AI Overviews and AI Mode, we know that query
growth is accelerating, but can you help us understand from there kind of what happens in terms of clicks per
query and conversion rates and pricing in these AI-driven search formats?
And then, Anat, can you talk about where you see opportunities in the core cost base as you look to make room
to absorb the rapid growth in infrastructure and depreciation going forward? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philipp Schindler A
Chief Business Officer & Senior Vice President, Google LLC
So, let me give you a bit of vertical color first. In Q3, Search & other revenues again delivered growth across all
major verticals, as we said, it was from retail and financial services. Healthcare was also a contributor to the
growth here. Our new AI experiences, you mentioned AI Overviews, AI Mode, continue to drive growth in overall
queries, including commercial queries, really creating more opportunities for monetization. AI Overviews are
scaling up and are working for our entire user base.
We're now scaled to over 2 billion users here, and we're continuing to expand Ads in AI Overviews in English to
more countries, across desktop, mobile and so on. And as I've shared before, for AI Overviews, even at our
current baseline of Ads, the low end within the AI's response, overall, we see the monetization at approximately
the same rate.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2025
So, over time, we're excited about the opportunity of richer experiences in AI Mode and AI Overviews to basically
open up then the opportunity for also a much richer placements. And I think as I've said on a prior call, we
manage the business to drive great outcomes for our users and an attractive ROI for advertisers. We don't really
manage to paid clicks and CPC targets. But as you will see in the 10-Q, paid clicks were up 7% year-on-year and
CPCs were up 7% year-on-year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anat Ashkenazi A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Alphabet, Inc.
Doug, and to your question around where else can we see more opportunity for efficiency and productivity. And I
think, you heard me say before, this is not a one-time type of effort, but rather an ongoing way in which we
manage the business, and the key here is that the more we drive productivity across our business, the more we
can invest in the business for growth and obviously continue to drive improvement in the P&L.
Some of the areas are things that you've heard us talk about in the past, such as moderating the pace of head
count growth, optimizing our real estate footprint, but also as we invest more and more in our technical
infrastructure, ensuring that we are optimizing that build-out and the overall technical infrastructure we have that a
lot of the data centers, for example, that we build ourselves, so they're optimized and we make sure we do them
in the most efficient way.
Sundar mentioned on one of the previous calls, the productivity associated with leveraging AI for Google. So, this
– the example, the percent of code, now nearly half of all code generated by AI, that's a way for us to leverage AI
to drive further productivity across the business.
And obviously, we always look at making sure that when we provide services or products that we get the right
economics and the right value for what we provide. So, the one good example is Shorts, which has a lower
revenue share than in stream that helps to improve some of our gross margins.
So, this is an effort we have ongoing. I've mentioned in the past that we have headwind with depreciation,
obviously, increasing alongside our CapEx increase. So, we're – we have efforts across the organization to
ensure we run the business in the most disciplined and productive way while continuing to invest for future
growth.

Eric J. Sheridan Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Thank you so much for taking the questions. Maybe two, if I could. Sundar, when you think about your custom
silicon efforts across the organization, can you reflect a little bit about the opportunity set you see, with each
passing generation of custom silicon both in terms of driving operating efficiencies inside the organization and
potentially increased monetization efforts around those outside of the organization.
Second question would be for Philipp. Obviously, we could see the YouTube advertising revenue number in the
reported results. Can we reflect a little bit about the scaling of the subscription side of YouTube offerings and how

the two parts together maybe represent an interesting framework in thinking about the monetization side of
YouTube, increasingly being a mix of both ads and subscription. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Eric, overall, I would say, we are seeing substantial demand for our AI infrastructure products, including TPU-
based and GPU-based solutions. It is one of the key drivers of our growth over the past year. And I think on a
going-forward basis, I think we continue to see very strong demand, and we are investing to meet that.
I do think a big part of what differentiates Google Cloud effectively we are the- we have taken a full, deep full-
stack approach to AI. So, we are – and that really plays out, right? We are the only hyperscaler who is really
building offerings on our own models. And we are also highly differentiated on our own technology.
So, to your question, I think that does give us the opportunity to continue driving growth in operating margins in
Cloud, as we have done in the past. And also, I think, from a revenue sets the infrastructure portion of our
business to be a growth driver looking ahead as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philipp Schindler A
Chief Business Officer & Senior Vice President, Google LLC
And to the second part of your question, look, just taking a quick step back. We often describe YouTube's
business as a flywheel. Obviously, it first all starts with the creators, and we have significantly invested here to be
the place that YouTube creators really call their home. That's a big piece of it, the number one piece.
Viewers, of course, YouTube has billions of monthly logged-in users and every day, people watch billions of hours
of video and we talked about how our recommendation systems are driving robust watch time growth and so on
and so on.
So, on the monetization side, YouTube's business is really powered, I would say on a – let's call it a twin engine
monetization strategy, combining its advertising business and its growing subscription services. Both YouTube
Ads and Subscription saw strong growth this quarter. And so, looking at YouTube Music and Premium, users are,
on average, delivering more value to creators, to music, media partners and YouTube itself than even ad
supported users do.
So in other words, on average, a YouTube Music and Premium subscriber generates a meaningful high gross
profit than they were simply an ad-supported users. And fans come from all over the world. You know this and this
engagement through ads and subscription generates YouTube's revenue and funds what I started with these
creators here and this then drives more viewership and engagement and so on, and that's the flywheel. And so,
our priority continues like this growth cycle. We're happy with this twin engine monetization strategy.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Shmulik Q
Analyst, Bernstein Institutional Services LLC
Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. Sundar, with the strong adoption of Gemini, AI Mode and Overviews across
the user base, are there any meaningful differences to call out kind of around the behavior and depth of
engagement for those users across the entire Google ecosystem.

And then, Philipp, I know we kind of ask this most quarters, but I'm curious kind of what some of the adoption
you've seen around AI Overviews and Mode, how you see the economics of Search evolving with the higher
commercial and total query volume? And how it kind of compares against the incremental cost to deliver these
results. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Mark, look, I think, obviously, AI Overviews are a natural part of the Google experience. And so, engagement is
very, very high. I would say AI Mode, you have varied cohorts that are people who are casual users who are
checking it out. And then – but there's a core group which really likes AI Mode and is passionate about it. And so,
you see the early adopters – the product is resonating very strongly and they are seeking it out. So, I think that's
how I would highlight the difference. With Gemini again, sort of engaged user base who are seeking out the
product and so on.
But across the board, I think, the trajectory has been we are definitely seeing in each of those use cases, a set of
early adopters and then more people coming in and the people who are using it continue to use it more over time
and report high user satisfaction. So, I would say the underlying product metrics are pretty encouraging to see as
well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philipp Schindler A
Chief Business Officer & Senior Vice President, Google LLC
Looking to the second part of your question. I think, we covered before, Sundar covered the core development.
And as I've just said before, for the AI Overviews, even at our current baseline of Ads, right, whether above, below
and within the AI response, overall, we see the monetization at approximately the same rate. And this is a great
baseline for further innovation. We talked about this. We're excited about where this can go. And on the AI Mode
side, we're testing as an AI Mode, and we'll continue to test and learn before we expand this any further. So that's
in combination with what we mentioned about the commercial query overall development, I think, we're in a good
place here.
You could also argue that on queries that historically have not been well monetized. We think there is a potential
opportunity here where you can obviously imagine that we can build this out with smart AI integration.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Brian Nathanson Q
Analyst, MoffettNathanson LLC
Thanks. I have two, one for Philipp, one for Anat. Philipp, it's clear that when people use AI Mode, the query
length is much longer. Could you talk about how that longer length maybe impacting your ability to drive ROAS
and what you're seeing in terms of some of the early – the benefits of maybe longer query length?
And then Anat, you came to Alphabet from a pharmaceutical company. You've been there more than a year. Can
you talk a bit about how you're working to look at ROIC internally? And what early signs are you seeing that gives
you confidence that the spending is really driving better returns longer term? Thanks.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2025
Look, as Sundar shared AI Mode now has over like 75 million daily active users in the US and we see strong and
consistent week-over-week growth in usage since launch and the queries doubled over the quarter. And as I also
mentioned, we're testing ads in AI Mode. We'll continue to test before we expand any further. It's really too early
to tell and go into any of the details of that testing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Brian Nathanson Q
Analyst, MoffettNathanson LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anat Ashkenazi A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Alphabet, Inc.
Yes. And the question related to ROIC and how we look at just overall our business and where do we see early
signs that are encouraging? So first, I would say it's not just early signs because we're seeing returns, obviously,
in the Cloud business. You've heard us talk about the fact that we already are generating billions of dollars from
AI in the quarter.
But then across the board, we have a rigorous framework and approach by which we evaluate these long-term
investments that are meant to do two things. One is to ensure we have – we build a resilient growth profile for the
company, but also that we meet the demand of the customers that we have here in the more near and mid-term.
So, we look at it across the business. We evaluate the potential return for each one of them, whether it's in Cloud,
and I think that's more visible, obviously, externally given that you see the revenue generated and the fact that
we're unable to meet at this point, customer demand. We have more demand than we have supplied.
In our Ads business, you see the fact that we're investing to transform Search, as you heard from Philipp and
Sundar, with AIO and AI Mode. So, we're excited to see what our investments are help – how our investments are
helping advertisers as well. YouTube, where it's helping power recommendations.
So, we're – when we make a decision on investment in the long term, we go through a very rigorous process of
assessing what the return could be and over what timeframe we will see that return to give us the high level of
confidence to then invest and make those investments for the long term. So, it's a very rigorous approach.

Ross Sandler Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. About 20% of Google's search queries are commercial historically. And you've talked a bunch on this call
about how AI Overviews are kind of expanding the breadth of queries. Could you talk about how new product
from the monetization side like AI Max are potentially increasing the percent of commercial queries?

So, look, AI Max, and I mentioned this in my call before, improves the ability for advertisers to target a wider
range of queries. Separately, there is the question of whether queries actually increase with AI Mode, and I think
Sundar actually talked about it and mentioned the opportunity that he sees here. So, I think it's important to
separate those two things.
And I personally also see this – what I just said in my last remark, that I think over time, there's an opportunity to
actually take, let's say, queries that are not fully commercial, but could have an adjacent commercial relationship
to basically expand this into more attractive ads offerings without – while really creating a really interesting user
experience at the same time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Yeah. And the only thing I would add is just stepping back broadly, I think AI Overviews and AI Mode are
dramatically improving search. We can see it in user satisfaction, user quality, all our metrics and they're universal
in the nature. They apply across the universality of human needs. So, I think, we are seeing it in breadth. And so
naturally, over time, that will apply to commercial categories as well.

Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.

Kenneth J. Gawrelski Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
Thank you very much. Two questions, please. First, it appears more and more clear that all the new modes – at
Google with Gemini, AI Overviews, AI Mode, even ChatGPT is growing the addressable market for engagement
and search-like behavior. Could you talk about what gives you confidence that it will also grow the addressable
market for marketing activity and overall revenue associated with that behavior? That's question one.
And question two is just more about as you think about AI Mode, AI Overviews and traditional Google Search,
how do you think – do you see a world in 12 to 24 months, those all coexist? And does the user – does a user
eventually pick what mode they want? Is that the algorithm picks the mode? Could you talk a little bit about how
you think that will progress over the next 12 to 24 months? Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Ken, thanks. Look, I think, it's a dynamic moment and I think we are meeting people in the moment with what they
are trying to do. Obviously, Search is evolving and between AI Overviews and AI Mode, I think we are able to kind
of give that range of experience for people in this moment. Over time, you will expect us to – you can expect us to
make the experiences simpler in a way that just like we did universal search many years ago. We may have done
text search, image search, video search, et cetera, and then we kind of brought it together as Universal Search.
So, you will see evolutions like that, but I think we want to be sensitive to making sure we are meeting the users in
terms of what they are looking for. I think Gemini allows us to build a more personal, proactive, powerful AI
assistant for that moment. And I think having the two surfaces, Search and Gemini, allows us to really serve users
across the breadth of their needs. But over time, we will thoughtfully look for opportunities to make the experience
better for users.
And to the first part, I would broadly say as – I do think we've been consistently saying for a while now, this is an
expansionary moment, and we are seeing people engage more. And I think, when they do that, naturally a portion

of that information for users that those journeys are commercial in nature. So, I would expect that to play out over
time as well.

Justin Post Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Great. Just a couple. Sundar, I think you mentioned Gemini 3 is coming. Maybe you can comment on the pace of
innovation in frontier models. Is there still just a tremendous amount of innovation or is it slowing at all? And then
you mentioned a number of large deals signed in the last nine months for Cloud, which is great. Any changes in
the economics of these deals as far as long-term profitability? Anything we should be aware of? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks, Justin. The first on the pace of frontier model research and development, look, I think two things are both
simultaneously true. I'm incredibly impressed by the pace at which the teams are executing and the pace at which
we are improving these models.
But it also is true at the same time that each of the prior model you are trying to get better over is now getting
more and more capable. So, I think, both the pace is increasing, but sometimes we are taking the time to put out
a notably improved model. So, I think – and that may take slightly longer. But I do think the underlying pace is
phenomenal to see. And I'm excited about our Gemini 3.0 release later this year.
On Cloud, I would point out as a sign of the momentum, I think, the number of deals greater than $1 billion that
we signed in the first three quarters of this year are greater than the two years prior, so we are definitely seeing
strong momentum, and we are executing at pace.
And in terms of long-term economics, I would say that, again, us being a full-stack AI player. And the fact that we
are developing highly differentiated products on our own technology, I think, will help us drive a good trajectory
here as you have seen over the past few years.

Sundar Pichai
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a standout quarter for us with robust growth across the
company. As you saw at I/O, we are leading at the frontier of AI and shipping at an incredible pace.
AI is positively impacting every part of the business, driving strong momentum. This quarter, Search delivered
double-digit revenue growth. Our new Search features continue to perform well. AI mode has launched in the US
and India and is going well.
While AI Overviews now has over 2 billion monthly users across more than 200 countries and territories and 40
languages. I'll give some more details on Search in a moment.
We continue to see strong performance in YouTube as well as Subscriptions, reflecting great momentum across
these high-growth businesses. In the US, Shorts now earned as much revenue per watch-hour as traditional in-
stream on YouTube. And in some countries, it now even exceeds in-stream's rate.
Cloud had another great quarter of strong growth in revenues, backlog, and profitability. Its annual revenue run
rate is now more than $50 billion. We are seeing significant demand for our comprehensive AI product portfolio.
Of course, this is all possible because of the long-term investments we have made in our differentiated full-stack
approach to AI. This pans AI infrastructure, world-class research, models and tooling, and our products and
platforms that brings AI to people all over the world.
I'll briefly touch on the AI stack before turning to quarterly highlights. First, AI infrastructure. We operate the
leading global network of AI-optimized data centers and cloud regions. We also offer the industry's widest range
of TPUs and GPUs, along with storage and software built on top.
That's why nearly all Gen AI Unicorns use Google Cloud. And it's why a growing number, including leading AI
research labs like Safe Superintelligence, and Physical Intelligence, use TPU specifically. Our AI infrastructure
investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand from cloud customers.
Next, world-class AI research, including models and tooling. We continue to expand our Gemini 2.5 family of
hybrid reasoning models, which provide industry-leading performance in nearly every major benchmark. In
addition to improving our popular workhorse model Flash, we debuted an extremely fast flashlight version.
We achieved gold medal level performance in the international Math Olympiad using an advanced version of
Gemini with DeepThink. We can't wait to bring DeepThink to users soon. We have some of the best models
available today at every price point. Our 2.5 models have been a catalyst for growth and 9 million developers
have now built with Gemini.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2025
I also want to mention Veo 3, our state-of-the-art video generation model. It's been a viral hit with people sharing
clips created in the Gemini app and with our new AI filmmaking tool Flow. Since May, over 70 million videos have
been generated using Veo 3. And we recently introduced a feature in the Gemini app to turn photos into videos,
which people absolutely love. It's also rolling out to Google Photos users starting today.
Third, our products and platforms. We are bringing AI to all our users and partners through surfaces like
Workspace, Chrome and more. The growth in usage has been incredible.
At I/O in May, we announced that we processed 480 trillion monthly tokens across our surfaces. Since then, we
have doubled that number, now processing over 980 trillion monthly tokens, a remarkable increase.
The Gemini app now has more than 450 million monthly active users and we continue to see strong growth and
engagement with daily requests growing over 50% from Q1. In June alone, over 50 million people used AI-
powered meeting notes in Google Meet. And powered by Veo 3, our new short video product in Workspace called
Google Vids reached nearly 1 million monthly active users.
This month at Samsung Galaxy Unpack, we announced new Android and AI features that are available on
Samsung's latest devices. And we are really pleased with the growth in subscriptions, which got a boost from our
Google AI Pro and Ultra plans.
Now, some key highlights from Search, Cloud, YouTube and Waymo for the quarter. First up, this is an incredibly
exciting moment for Search. We see AI powering an expansion in how people are searching for and accessing
information, unlocking completely new kinds of questions you can ask Google. Overall queries and commercial
queries on Search continue to grow year-over-year, and our new AI experiences significantly contributed to this
increase in usage.
We are also seeing that our AI features cause users to search more as they learn that Search can meet more of
their needs. That's especially true for younger users. Let me go deeper on our new Search experiences. We know
how popular AI Overviews are because they are now driving over 10% more queries globally for the types of
queries that show them. And this growth continues to increase over time.
AI Overviews are now powered by Gemini 2.5, delivering the fastest AI responses in the industry. We also saw
strong growth in the use of multimodal search, particularly the combination of Lens or Circle to Search together
with AI Overviews. This growth was most pronounced among younger users.
Our new end-to-end AI Search experience, AI Mode continues to receive very positive feedback, particularly for
longer and more complex questions. It's still rolling out, but already has over 100 million monthly active users in
the US and India. We plan to keep enhancing the AI Mode experience for users by shipping great features fast.
That includes our advanced research tool, Deep Search and more personalized responses.
Next, Google Cloud. We see strong customer demand, driven by our product differentiation and our
comprehensive AI product portfolio. Four stats show this. One, the number of deals over $250 million, doubling
year-over-year; two, in the first half of 2025 we signed the same number of deals over $1 million that we did in all
of 2024; three, the number of new GCP customers increased by nearly 28% quarter-over-quarter; four, more than
85,000 enterprises, including LVMH, Salesforce, and Singapore's DBS Bank now built with Gemini, driving a 35x
growth in Gemini usage year-over-year.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2025
Our models have served on our AI infrastructure, which offers industry-leading performance and cost efficiency
for both training and inference. Along with our AI accelerators, we introduced new innovations in storage,
including Anywhere Cache, which improves inference latency by up to 70% and rapid storage, which delivers a 5x
improvement in latency compared to leading hyperscalers.
In addition, we have optimized AI software packages, including PyTorch, and JAX, with full open source supports
for various AI training and serving demands. We've also integrated AI Agents deeply into each of our Cloud
products.
Mayfair is leveraging our databases, integrated with AI to streamline data pipelines and deliver more personalized
customer experiences. Mattel is leveraging our Gemini powered data agents and big query to review and act on
product feedback more quickly. Target is using our Gemini-powered Threat Intelligence and Security Operations
Agents to improve cybersecurity.
Capgemini is utilizing our AI software engineering agents to deliver higher quality software faster by automating
tasks from code generation to testing. And BBVA says Gemini and Google Workspace is saving employees
nearly three hours per week by automating repetitive tasks. It's now rolling it out to 100,000 employees globally.
We are also focused on building a flourishing AI agent ecosystem. We introduced an open-source agent
development kit, which now has over 1 million downloads in less than four months. We also introduced
Agentspace, an open and interoperable enterprise Chat, Search and Agent platform.
Gordon Food Service is bringing Agentspace to its US employees, which is enabling better, more efficient
decision-making. And over 1 million subscriptions have been booked for Agentspace ahead of its general
availability.
Turning now to YouTube. Nielsen data shows YouTube has led US streaming watch time for over two years. A
generation that grew up with YouTube on their devices is now increasingly watching their favorite creators and
content on their televisions, that includes billions of sports fans, too.
Globally, they consume more than 40 billion hours of sports content on YouTube annually. And in September,
we'll stream the NFL's first Friday game of the season, live from Brazil.
From sports to shorts, we now average over 200 billion daily views on YouTube Shorts. AI is helping improve our
recommendations and auto dubbing, which translates to better returns for creators and brands by dramatically
increasing the potential audiences they can reach. And today, we began rolling out a whole raft of new AI tools for
creators on YouTube Shorts.
Finally, YouTube continues to diversify its subscription options, recently expanding its Premium Lite offerings to
15 new countries, with more to come.
And lastly, Waymo continues to scale and expand to safely serve more riders in more places. Last month, Waymo
launched in Atlanta, more than doubled its Austin service territory and expanded its Los Angeles and San
Francisco Bay area territories by approximately 50%. Waymo also launched teen accounts, starting with riders
aged 14 to 17, in Phoenix. Overall, great momentum here.

The Waymo driver has now autonomously driven over 100 million miles on public roads, and the team is testing
across more than 10 cities this year, including New York and Philadelphia. We hope to serve riders in all 10 in the
future. As I said, a standout quarter. A big thank you as always to our employees and partners for an amazing Q2.
Philipp, over to you.

Philipp Schindler
Chief Business Officer & Senior Vice President, Google, Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. I'll quickly cover performance for Google Services for the quarter, then
structure the rest of my remarks around the great progress we're delivering across Search, Ads, YouTube, and
Partnerships.
Google Services revenues were $83 billion for the quarter, up 12% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in
Search and YouTube, partially offset by year-on-year decline in network revenues.
To add some further color to our results, the 12% increase in Search and other revenues was led by growth
across all verticals, with the largest contributions from retail and financial services. YouTube saw similar
performance across verticals. Its 13% growth in advertising revenues was driven by direct response, followed by
brand.
Starting with Search and other revenues, which delivered over $54 billion in revenue for the quarter. Shifts like AI
are what propels our industry forward. Gemini's native multimodality is helping bring the offline audio and visual
world back into the online world, creating a number of opportunities for Search. Let me share a few examples.
Take visual queries. Google Lens searches are one of the fastest growing query types on search, and grew 70%
since this time last year. The majority of Lens searches are incremental, and we're seeing healthy growth for
shopping queries using Lens, and you can obviously take this to the next level by moving from image to video-
based capabilities like Search Live.
And then there's Circle to Search, which is now on over 300 million Android devices. We've been adding
capabilities to help people explore complex topics and ask follow-up questions without switching apps. For
example, gamers can now use Circle to Search while playing mobile games to see an AI Overview for answers.
And just last week, we brought a new agentic capability directly into Search for all US users with AI-powered
calling to local businesses.
Finally, Shopping, where in Q2 we introduced a virtual try-on experience for Search Labs users in the US. Now
people can try billions of clothing products on themselves virtually. Early results and engagement have been
extremely positive, particularly with Gen Z users, and we'll be bringing this functionality to all US users imminently.
All these innovations are opening up completely new ways for people to use technology, bringing the offline world
into the online world in ways that simply have not been possible before.
Add in our amazing AI translation capabilities and just imagine the possibilities. People can access more content
in their language and businesses, large and small, international or local, can reach even more customers. I'm
excited about how all of these elements will come together and the opportunities ahead of us in Search.
Moving to Ads, where our strategy to reinvent the entire marketing process with AI is delivering value for our
customers and our business.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2025
Last quarter, we introduced AI Max in Search, a new suite of AI-powered features in existing search campaigns.
Advertisers that activate AI Max in Search campaigns typically see 14% more conversions.
On media buying, Smart Bidding Exploration, the biggest update to bidding strategy in a decade, brings better
performance to advertisers by allowing them to bid on less obvious, but potentially higher-value queries more
often. Campaigns using Smart Bidding Exploration see a 19% increase in conversions on average.
Demand Gen continues to drive revenue growth and deliver measurable impact for our customers. As an
example, Depop, Etsy's resale clothing marketplace used a Shorts-only Demand Gen campaign to drive new
customers to the site. Shorts drove 80% higher brand lift and double click-through rates versus benchmarks.
On Creatives, we launched Asset Studio using our latest models to help businesses, large and small, generate
Creative assets. Small businesses benefit from top quality assets and deployment scaling capabilities, but larger
businesses can go faster from proof of concept to launch and resize at lower cost. Over 2 million advertisers now
use Google's AI-powered asset generation tools to run ads, a 50% increase on this time last year.
Turning to YouTube, where we saw continued strong revenue growth, driven by direct response followed by
brand. YouTube creators are connected to the global zeitgeist and trusted by their audiences like no others.
As part of Brand Connect, we launched Creator Partnership Hub, which allows brands to more easily work with
the right creators and tap into cultural moments. We introduced Veo 3, photo to video and generative effects to
Shorts, making content creation easier and offering unexplored avenues for creativity.
We're seeing both the volume and the price of Ads and Shorts increase, particularly in developed markets. The
feed-based nature of the product allows for more ad opportunities on average, and this growth is further
supported by ad formats native to Shorts, AI-powered ad creative resizing tools, improved ad targeting, and the
rise in viewer engagement.
McDonald's USA harnessed the influence of YouTube creators to ignite awareness for the Minecraft Movie Meal.
It leveraged YouTube Shorts partnership ads to increase its reach, generating a 3.3 times higher view through
rate than the industry benchmark.
Finally, on CTV where the momentum continues. According to the gauge report by Nielsen, YouTube has been
number one in streaming watch-time in the US for more than two years, hitting a record high of 12.8% of total TV
viewing in June 2025.
In the past 12 months, YouTube ads viewed on CTV screens drove over 1 billion conversions. We saw strong
growth in retail thanks to CTV shopping ads, which allows viewers to shop directly via QR codes, helping us
leverage direct marketing opportunities.
As always, I'll wrap up with the momentum we're seeing in partnerships, where our customers increasingly
recognize the strength and breadth of Google's ability to help them transform their business with AI.
For instance, a new partnership with PayPal will improve the digital commerce experience for their merchants and
customers. PayPal will expand its Google Cloud adoption for AI-driven recommendations, transaction processing,
and enhanced security. The partnership also broadens the availability and functionality of PayPal's payment
services and capabilities across a range of Google products.

In closing, I'd like to thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions and commitment to our success and to our
customers and partners for their continued trust.
Anat, over to you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anat Ashkenazi
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President-Google, Alphabet, Inc.
Thank you, Philipp. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I state
otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level and will then cover our segment results. I'll end with some
commentary on our outlook for second half of 2025.
We had another solid quarter in Q2. Consolidated revenue of $96.4 billion increased by 14%, or 13% in constant
currency.
Search and YouTube Advertising, Subscription, Platforms & Devices, and Google Cloud each had double-digit
revenue growth this quarter, reflecting strong momentum across the business.
Total cost of revenue was $39 billion, up 10%. Tech was $14.7 billion, up 10%; and other cost of revenue was
$24.3 billion, up 10%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube,
followed by depreciation. Total operating expenses increased 20% to $26.1 billion. The biggest driver of growth
was expense for legal and other matters, which reflected the impact of $1.4 billion charge related to a settlement
in principle of certain legal matters.
R&D investments increased by 16%, primarily driven by increases in compensation and depreciation expenses.
Sales and marketing expenses increased 5%, primarily reflecting an increase in advertising and promotional
expenses. Operating income increased 14% this quarter to $31.3 billion and operating margin was 32.4%.
Operating margin benefited from strong revenue growth and continued efficiencies in our expense base, partially
offset by the legal charge I mentioned earlier, and a significant increase in depreciation expense. Net income
increased 19% to $28.2 billion, and earnings per share increased 22% to $2.31.
We generated free cash flow of $5.3 billion in the second quarter and $66.7 billion for the trailing 12 months. Free
cash flow in the second quarter was affected by a sizable sequential increase in CapEx and cash tax payments,
as we make federal tax payments in the second quarter for both Q1 and Q2. We ended the quarter with $95
billion in cash and marketable securities.
Turning to segment results. Google Services revenues increased 12% to $82.5 billion, reflecting strength in
Google Search and YouTube advertising and subscriptions. Google Search and other revenues increased by
12% to $54.2 billion. Search and other revenues delivered growth across all verticals with the largest contributions
coming from retail and financial services. YouTube Advertising revenues increased 13% to $9.8 billion, driven by
direct response advertising, followed by brand, network advertising revenue of $7.4 billion were down 1%.
Subscription, Platforms & Devices revenues increased 20% to $11.2 billion, primarily reflecting growth in
subscription revenues. This growth was driven by YouTube subscription offerings followed by Google One, with
the growth in paid subscriptions being the biggest driver of revenue growth. Google Service operating income
increased 11% to $33.1 billion.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2025
Operating margin was flat year-on-year at 40.1% as healthy revenue growth and continued efficiency in our
expense base were partially offset by the legal charge I mentioned earlier.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment, which delivered very strong results this quarter. Revenues increased by
32% to $13.6 billion in the second quarter, reflecting growth in GCP across core and AI products at the rate that
was much higher than Cloud's overall revenue growth, and growth in Google Workspace, driven by an increase in
average revenue per seat and the number of seats.
Google Cloud operating income increased to $2.8 billion, and operating margin increased from 11.3% to 20.7%.
The expansion in cloud operating margin was driven by strong revenue performance and continued efficiencies in
our expense base, partially offset by higher technical infrastructure usage costs, which includes the associated
depreciation.
As we ramp our AI investments, we continue to focus on driving improvements in productivity and efficiency to
offset growth in technical infrastructure-related expenses, particularly from higher depreciation. Google Cloud
backlog increased 18% sequentially in Q2 and 38% year-over-year, reaching $106 billion at the end of the
quarter. This growth was driven by strong demand for our products and services from both new and existing
customers.
As Sundar mentioned, we have signed multiple billion dollar plus deals in the first half of the year. As to our Other
Bets, in the second quarter, revenue were $373 million and operating loss was $1.2 billion. Within Other Bets,
we're allocating more resources to businesses like Waymo, where we see opportunities to create additional value.
With respect to CapEx in the second quarter, our CapEx was $22.4 billion. The vast majority of our CapEx was
invested in technical infrastructure with approximately two-third of investments in servers and one-third in data
centers and networking equipment. In Q2, we returned capital to shareholders through repurchase of stock of
$13.6 billion and dividend payments of $2.5 billion.
Turning to our outlook. I would like to provide some commentary on several factors that will impact our business
performance in the second half of 2025, as well as an updated outlook for full year CapEx.
First, in terms of revenues, we're pleased with the overall momentum we're seeing across the business. At current
spot rates, we could see a tailwind to our revenue in Q3. However, volatility in exchange rates could affect the
impact of FX on Q3 revenue.
As for our segments, in Google Services, advertising revenues in the second half of 2025 will be affected by the
following: The continued lapping of the strength we experienced in financial service verticals throughout 2024 and
year-over-year comparisons will be negatively impacted by the strong spend on US election in the second half of
2024, particularly on YouTube.
In Cloud, as I mentioned, the demand for our products is high as evidenced by the continued revenue growth and
the cloud backlog of $106 billion. While we have been working hard to increase capacity and have improved the
pace of server deployment, we expect to remain in a tight demand supply environment going into 2026.
Moving to investments. Given the strong demand for our Cloud products and services, we now expect to invest
approximately $85 billion in CapEx in 2025, up from a previous estimate of $75 billion. Our updated outlook
reflects additional investment in servers, the timing of delivery of servers and an acceleration in the pace of data
center construction, primarily to meet cloud customer demand.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2025
Looking out to 2026, we expect a further increase in CapEx, due to the demand we're seeing from customers as
well as growth opportunities across the company. We will provide more details on the 2026 CapEx outlook on a
future earnings call.
In terms of expenses, first, as I mentioned in our previous earnings call, the significant increase in our
investments in CapEx over the past few years will continue to put pressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of
higher depreciation. In the second quarter, depreciation increased $1.3 billion year-over-year to $5 billion,
reflecting a growth rate of 35%. Given the recent increase in CapEx investments, we expect the growth rate and
depreciation to accelerate further in Q3.
Second, as we've previously said, we expect some head count growth in 2025 in key investment areas. In the
third quarter, we expect a sequential increase in total head count additions due in part to the hiring of new
graduates.
And third, Q3 will reflect the expense associated with the upcoming August launch of the new Pixel family of
products.
In conclusion, as you heard from Sunder and Philipp, we're pleased with the momentum in the business and
excited about the pace of innovation. Our full stack approach, which combines AI Infrastructure, AI Research and
AI Products and Platforms position us well to deliver new products and services across the company. We're
seeing great momentum with our AI efforts as demonstrated by the increase in cumulative token processed.
Search revenues are seeing healthy growth with features like AI Overviews, AI Mode and Lens, offering new
ways for users to access information.
Cloud has reached an annual revenue run rate of more than $50 billion and is delivering margin expansion while
continuing to invest to meet customer demand. And YouTube has expanded its addressable market by building
new services like Shorts, which now averages over 200 billion daily views. We're excited to see the value our
products and services are bringing to customers and partners around the globe.
Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator, and Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.
Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric J. Sheridan Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Thank you so much for taking the question. Maybe one for Sundar and one for Philipp. Sundar, when you think
about the journey you're on with respect to the evolution of products and platforms, how do you think about some
of the implications of changed consumer behavior and how investors should think about that from the volume
perspective versus the monetization perspective? So, I think there's a lot of long-standing dynamics out there
about clicks and click monetization that might be very different when you look out over the next three to five years.
And Philipp, when you think about the evolution of YouTube, you made a number of comments there about
subscription revenue, I'm just curious how you think about the mix of advertising versus subscription? And what
some of your key learnings might have been as the subscription side of the business continues to scale? Thank
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks, Eric. I appreciate the question. I don't think looking ahead, based on everything we are seeing, it's –
people are excited about AI. They are adopting it well across our products, for me just seeing multimodality, how
people have modified their behavior to include images, both through Lens and Circle to Search seamlessly as
part of interacting with Google are early indications that people are going to be adopting through these moments
very, very well.
I think I'm trying to understand your question in terms of about clicks and click monetization, maybe that's
something Philipp can touch on. But overall, we expect as we build out our organic experiences, we have a good
understanding of how to continue training on monetization, so that will work well with organic experiences and –
but we will lead with organic experience. So, in terms of newer surfaces like Gemini app et cetera, we will focus
on the organic experience for the near-term. But just like we are doing with AI Overviews and with AI Mode over
time, we'll be able to bring very, very good commercial experiences there as well. And we think people will adapt
to them as they've always done. Maybe Philipp can add more. Philipp?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philipp Schindler A
Chief Business Officer & Senior Vice President, Google, Alphabet, Inc.
Yes. So, on your question on YouTube Subscriptions versus Ads. Look, I mean, we love our Ads business. We
love our subscription business. YouTube subscriptions are increasingly important for YouTube. We'll definitely
continue our long-term focus here.
We had a strong growth across YouTube Subscription products, which includes, just to be clear, YouTube TV,
YouTube Music, and Premium. And I think one common theme for our subscription services in general is offering
viewers more choice here.

We also have a very deep understanding of the monetization side here, where we're monetizing more with ads,
where can we potentially monetize more with subscriptions? So, I think we will continue this as a double tier
strategy actively going forward.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Doug Anmuth Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks so much for taking the questions. One for Sundar, and one for Philipp. Sundar, can you just talk about
how you're thinking about your current access to compute, even as you spend $10 billion more this year in
CapEx, you also said that you're still in a tight supply environment, so you're trying to marry those?
And then Philipp, perhaps on Search growth, can you talk a little bit about paid click and pricing growth just within
the 12% Search growth and how we should think about volume versus monetization trends going forward?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Doug, thanks. On the CapEx stuff, obviously, we are seeing strong momentum across our portfolio, especially in
Cloud. You are right. It's a tight supply environment. And, we are investing more to expand. But there is obviously
a time delay between this additional investment will play out in future years. And so, that's why both of them are
true at the same time and – but we are planning ahead and we are investing and – but overall, it's exciting to see
the traction, particularly in Cloud.
I think the comprehensiveness of our AI portfolio, the breadth of our offerings, both providing our models on GPUs
and TPUs for our customers. All of that has been really driving demand. And so, we are investing to match up to
it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philipp Schindler A
Chief Business Officer & Senior Vice President, Google, Alphabet, Inc.
And on your paid click question, look, to be very clear, I think we said this before. We manage the business to
drive great outcomes for our users and an attractive ROI for our advertisers. We actually don't manage to pay
clicks and CPC targets. Some of the product and policy changes we make actually drive better monetization at
the expense of paid clicks.
You will actually see in the 10-Q, paid clicks were up 4% year-on-year. But a number of factors affect these
metrics from quarter-to-quarter, such as a few examples, advertiser spending, product changes, policy changes,
user engagement, and so on. So, it's really important when it comes to paid clicks and CPCs to avoid drawing like
overly broad conclusions solely based on these metrics.

Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Nowak Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First one, Sundar, there's a lot of discussion about agentic search for
commercial activities and agents that can be broadly deployed. Maybe could you just – from a technology
perspective, when you sit down with the engineering teams working on some of these new agentic capabilities
that could come, what are some of the predominant technological hurdles that need to be cleared in order to
launch scalable agents for commercial queries is the first one.
And the second one, I think in the past, you've updated us on stats on sources of internal efficiency you've seen
from GenAI-enabled capabilities. Any updates there? And then any sort of learnings on friction points that also
need to be overcome for some of these internal tools for GenAI? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks, Brian. Let me start with the first one on agentic capabilities. Look, overall, we are definitely, in many ways
when we built 2.5 – our series of 2.5 models, particularly with Pro, et cetera. It's the direction where we are
investing the most.
There's definitely exciting progress, including in the models we haven't fully released yet. And the main gaps
we're all trying to do is, you're obviously chaining a sequence of events. And so being able to do it reliably, the
latency compounds, the cost compounds and being able to do it reliably in a way for the users, all of this comes
together. In each of this, we are making progress, and it all needs to kind of hang together.
The good news is we are making robust progress. We think we are at the frontier there. And in all of these areas,
when you look back in a 12-month basis, you end up making the models much more efficient for any given
capability. So, the forward-looking trajectory, I think, will really unlock these agentic experiences. We see the
potential. We're able to do them but they're a bit slow and costly and takes time, and sometimes are [ph] brittle
(00:37:32), right? But we're making progress on all of that. And I think that's what will really unlock. And I expect
2026 to be the year in which people kind of use agentic experiences more broadly, right? And so, it's an exciting
opportunity ahead.
On the second part, I think when you say a source of internalization, I presume you're talking about how we are
using all of this internally. Again, given you've asked a question about agents, we are now beginning to roll out
agentic coding journeys for our software engineers within the company.
And it's been exciting to see just over the last few months, and particularly over the last few weeks, people are
definitely doing more agentic workflows and software engineering as well internally. And that's a good example of
the kind of – the same experiences a few months ago had a lot of friction points, but we are overcoming it and
people are beginning to use internally on the coding side as well as in certain other areas of the company as well.
So exciting progress. I expect it to be an active area where we will roll out journeys for our users as well. So, look
forward to it.

Thanks, Sundar. That's great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Brian Nathanson Q
Analyst, MoffettNathanson LLC
Thanks. Sundar, I have two for you. At I/O, you announced a partnership with Warby Parker to Develop glasses.
So, I wonder if you'd share your view of how important to cycle new devices will be to further scale AI and do you
envision a world in which the mobile phone is no longer central to our consumer experience? That's one.
And secondly, how does Google Search with AI mode usage differ versus Gemini stand-alone apps. So, I'm
wondering, are you seeing any differences in usage or the types of consumers who go to the app versus who go
to traditional Search with AI? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks, Michael. On the first thing, look, I think, any time I/O changes, you can drive new experiences, including
on hardware experiences too. So, I think AI will particularly enable. You've long heard the promise of glasses and
other form factors, but I think AI will spur a whole new wave of innovation there.
We are super excited about our investment in glasses and found the experiences have taken a dramatic step-up
compared to the last iteration. So, I think it will be an exciting new emerging category, but I still expect phones to
be at the center of experience for the next two to three years at least. And so, I still think that's going to be
phones, would continue to be at the center of the consumer experience. But we are excited about the emerging
categories as well.
On your second question on AI Mode versus Gemini standalone app. Broadly, there are some use cases where
you can get a great experience in both places, but there are use cases which are very specific. I think where the
queries are information-oriented but people really want to rely on the information, but have the full power of AI. I
think AI Mode really shines in that. You can go there, and it's backed up. The Gemini Models also using Search
deeply as a tool. And so, it's all grounded in that Search experience. And I think users are responding very
positively to it.
And whereas in the Gemini standalone app, you see everything from – people can have a long conversation of
chat just trying to pass time, right, in the Gemini app. You've seen early cases where people may get into it in a
therapy like experience, right? So, these are all emerging experiences of what people do. And I think this is why
I'm glad we have both surfaces and we can innovate in both of these areas. And of course, there will be areas
which will be commonly served by both applications. And over time, I think we can make experience more
seamless for our users.

Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Shmulik Q
Analyst, Bernstein Institutional Services LLC
Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Sundar, it seems there's almost like a daily news report about the AI talent
war and high-profile folks moving around, which is kind of like your perspective on how you think Google has
been doing at both kind of attracting and retaining key AI talent. And along the similar lines, how do we think
about AI-related resourcing costs alongside kind of the step up in capital investments required to go build for AI?
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Mark, on the first question, look, I think we've gone through these moments before. We've obviously always
deeply invested in talent, including in AI talent for well over a decade now. And I think we have an extraordinary
both breadth and depth of the talent. In my experience, the top people look for a combination of, they want to
really be at the frontier driving progress. And so, the mission and the – and how state-of-the-art your work is
matters. So that's super important to them, access to compute resources and access to your peers, right, working
with the best people in the industry, and it's a combination of all of that and using it to drive impact.
And I think we are pretty competitive on all those fronts. And through this moment, we continue to – I look at the –
both our retention metrics as well as the new talent coming in, and both are healthy. I do know individual cases
can make headlines, but when we look at numbers deeply, I think we are doing very well through this moment,
and we'll continue investing in the people and the talent and the compute needed to make sure we are set up for
the opportunity ahead.
And maybe I'll pass it on to Anat.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anat Ashkenazi A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President-Google, Alphabet, Inc.
Yeah, on the question on how we integrate this into our overall cost structure. And I've mentioned before, having
the – the benefit of having the full stack includes research, which is our people and one of our most critical
resource. So, we make sure that we invest appropriately to have the best and brightest minds in the industry
sitting here at Google and advancing our innovation to customers.
It is part of what you're seeing now in our operating expense line across the organization, but we're also working
hard to offset not just growth in investment across the business, but also to ensure that we can allocate resource
appropriately. So Sundar mentioned earlier, the use of AI tools within the company. So that's another area where
we can drive efficiency across the businesses to use these tools internally in terms of how we run the
organizations and then we're continuing on the same efforts that I've talked about before with regards to running
the company with a high level of discipline, execution and driving efficiency across the business.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ross Sandler Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. If I can ask two, that would be great. So, the first one is on Search click-through rates as a driver of
monetization. So, you guys have done a great job over the past decade of driving better ad relevancy and higher

click-through rates in Search. Just curious, as we look forward and we see lower ad impressions per SERP and
all these things that are changing with AI Overviews and different AI Search formats. How do you feel about your
ability to drive CTR going forward?
And then the second question is, it looks like you're now working with OpenAI for some aspect of cloud
infrastructure. Just curious how that relationship might expand in the future? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philipp Schindler A
Chief Business Officer & Senior Vice President, Google, Alphabet, Inc.
I can take the first one. Look, specifically referring to the AI Overviews, if I understood your question correctly,
Sundar mentioned it, they continue to drive higher satisfaction. They continue to drive higher Search usage.
They're scaling up very nicely and they're actually working for our entire user base now, scaled to over 2 billion
users, over 200 countries. So very happy with this development.
But when it comes specifically to the monetization of it, we talked about it before. We see monetization at
approximately the same rate, which gives us actually a really strong base on which we can then innovate and
drive actually a more innovative new and next-generation ad formats. That's how we look at it at this moment in
time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
On the second part, with respect to OpenAI, look, we are very excited to be partnering with them on Google
Cloud. Google Cloud is an open platform, and we have a strong history of supporting great companies, startups,
AI labs, et cetera. So super excited about our partnership there on the cloud side, and we look forward to
investing more in that relationship and growing it there.

Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Mahaney Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Two questions, please. First, could you just describe, maybe Philipp, what you see in terms of the ad
environment maybe for the back half of the year? Maybe versus last year, does it seem as certain or as uncertain
as it was last year, the results seemed pretty strong. Are there any unusual concerns you would have for the back
half of the year?
And then, Sundar, I want to ask you again about the two surfaces approach to Search. And you obviously got
some – you must have some internal metrics that would tell you that that's the optimal way for you to approach
the market. But there's – I'm sure there's a counterargument that just having that unified Search and being able to
discern the intent of the Search, whether it's pure information or commercial, just from the query that that could
give you a material advantage over other offerings in the market. Just talk a little bit about what metrics you've
seen that make it – that make the two surface solutions seem to be optimal. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philipp Schindler A
Chief Business Officer & Senior Vice President, Google, Alphabet, Inc.
So, let me start. Look, we said our Ads business performed strongly in Q2. Give you maybe some vertical color of
it in Q2, Search and other performance was led by growth across all verticals. We mentioned the largest
contributions from retail and financial services, which was probably due actually to strength in insurance. We saw
16

Alphabet, Inc.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2025
healthcare as a sizable contributor to growth as well. Look, we're only a few weeks into Q3. So, I think it's really
too early to comment on anything happening in the second half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Look, and Mark, on the second part of the question. Look, I think between these two surfaces, you pretty much –
you're covering the entire breadth and depth of what humanity can possibly do. So, I think the split for two
surfaces to tackle at this moment. Obviously, you are right, Search is more information-focused. And we think of
the Gemini app as more your assistant, more personal, proactive, and powerful assistant for every aspect of your
daily life.
And so, you can imagine wanting to code deeply or create a long video, et cetera, like those things can be done
by the Gemini app today better. Over time, like we've always done, we've gone through these evolutions before,
like, as you point out, we can understand user intent better and abstract some of the complexity for our users.
At one point, people used to go to – query separately for text, differently from images, differently from videos, et
cetera, and we kind of made it all seamless with universal search. So, we have the experience of being able to
bring together experiences in a way that makes sense for users and do the heavy lifting for them.
But I think when you're in this early stage of new emerging paradigms, I think we want to make sure we can meet
them where they – what they are expecting today. And over time, I think it will give us an opportunity to serve
them better. So, I think that's how we are thinking about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth J. Gawrelski Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
Thank you very much. Two, if I may, please. The first on Cloud, I'm just hoping maybe you could clarify your back-
half outlook. Given last quarter, you talked about some supply constraints that would ease towards the end of
2025, but yet you put up a really nice acceleration in 2Q. Now you're talking about some supply constraints easing
into 2026. If you could just clarify a little bit on the back-half outlook for Cloud, given the strong results in 2Q?
And then the second is a bigger picture question, which is an agentic experience, does it democratize the web like
Search did two decades ago, enabling discovery in the long tail? Or does it lead to more concentration with a
smaller group of vertical winners? Would love it if you could opine on that. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anat Ashkenazi A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President-Google, Alphabet, Inc.
Okay. On your first question on the Cloud second-half outlook and the comments I previously made on with
regards to where we're going to see the capacity increase. So, obviously, we're working hard to bring more
capacity online, which means data centers and servers that are coming online. And we see more of an increase
towards the back end of the year.
17

Alphabet, Inc.
(GOOG) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2025 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2025
But we're increasing capacity with every quarter that goes by, as you can see with the growth rates we've had
both this quarter and the previous quarter. As Sundar mentioned earlier, this is not the type of investment that's a
light switch. It takes time to make this investment. So, what you're seeing now is investment we made some time
ago, that's now translating to additional capacity coming online, but more of that towards the back end of the year.
I will say, it's important as you think about Cloud growth, not to think about this in a linear fashion, because the
quarter-on-quarter growth rates could depend on the timing of capacity delivery and when that comes online, so
that could move a little bit from quarter-to-quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Look, on the – on agentic experience. Look, I think there was an earlier question on the technology aspects of it
and how we are making progress. Obviously, there is the value proposition for all the players involved. And I think
that's going to be an equally important thing to create the unlock here.
And I do think over time, users will – it's clear to me as we make progress on the agentic experience, it's going to
be a much better experience for users, right. And so you'll find savvier players leaning into these experiences, and
that will help them grow and meet this moment. And I think – so I do think it's an opportunity for some of the
players. And so you are right, just like the early days of the web, there are aspects about it, which will expand
access, grow the use cases, et cetera. And I think that elements are there.
But I do think it's important. It's not just a technology play, but we have to solve the business models for the
varying players involved. So, I think that's going to be an important part of this evolution as well.

Justin Post Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Great, thank you. A couple for Sundar. First, it looks like the subscription businesses are all tracking well. And
certainly, Gemini 2.5 has got some much good reviews. How are you doing with Gemini subscriptions? I know it's
a focus area for the company. And anything you can do to accelerate the consumer subscriptions of Gemini within
Google One?
And then secondly, just on the course change of CapEx, obviously, a bigger increase, which appears to be
because of Cloud demand. But just your comments on Cloud ROI – sorry, CapEx ROI, what gives you confidence
that you're going to get good returns on that spend? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Great. On the first thing on subscriptions, we definitely – Google One has been an attractive value proposition
powered by storage. But now our AI plans, including both Pro and Ultra and particularly with the 2.5 series of
models, we have definitely seen accelerated traction. So it was a very healthy quarter. And so we are definitely
excited about the opportunities ahead.

And you will find through this moment, I think we'll be able to drive growth in that area based on our AI offerings.
And so it's definitely an area we are both excited by, and we are actually seeing traction, particularly in the last
quarter ever since we introduced 2.5 Pro, so we are excited about the trajectory there.
On the CapEx on the Cloud side, look, I think we are definitely investing because we are delivering a lot of value
through our Cloud offerings. And I think it's important to understand as we build more and more of an installed
base with Google Cloud, we have very high customer satisfaction. Our churn rates are very low and we are much
more efficient in the investments needed to grow those lines of businesses. So you're seeing all that play out in
our margin trajectory, particularly if you look at it annually, sequentially over the past few years.
And so all that gives us confidence as we are investing in this, we'll be able to have a healthy ROI on our
investments. And particularly in this AI moment, there's definitely – the value we are delivering to the customers is
also growing pretty significantly on a forward-looking basis. And so I think all that will help us do well here.

Dev C. Ittycheria
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Thank you, Brian, and thank you to everyone joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we got off to a strong
start in fiscal 2026 as we executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our first
quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $549 million, a 22% year-
over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 26% year-over-year,
representing 72% of revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $87 million for a 16% non-GAAP
operating margin and we ended the quarter with over 57,100 customers.
Overall, we posted a strong Q1 despite a dynamic and fast changing macro environment. We had a solid new
business quarter. We are beginning to see the benefit of our decision to focus our resources on the high end of
the market where we have the largest opportunity. Atlas consumption this quarter played out in line with our
expectations. Mike will discuss consumption trends in more detail and our expectations for the remainder of the
year.
Our total customer net adds are the highest in over six years, reflecting the continued strong adoption of
MongoDB across a wide range of industries and use cases. Self-serve customer additions were particularly
strong this quarter, reinforcing MongoDB's position as a go to platform for developers building the next generation
of applications, including many focused on AI. While these accounts typically start small, the self-serve channel is
a powerful engine for long-term growth. Finally, retention rates remained strong in Q1, demonstrating the quality
of our product and the mission criticality of our platform.
We are pleased with our Q1 performance. As I've said before, companies leverage software to execute their
business strategy, drive differentiation and improve operational efficiency. As the operational database that is the
core of software applications, MongoDB is undeniably a must have component of the tech stack. We continue to
make progress toward our goal of becoming the standard platform for enterprises and the default for developers
building new applications. At the heart of this momentum is MongoDB's modern architecture, which delivers real
and measurable advantages for the types of applications being built today, cloud native, distributed, real time and
the AI powered applications of tomorrow.
MongoDB's document model and the associated platform enables developers to more easily represent the
messiness of real world data, which includes understanding relationships between structured and unstructured
data and managing data that is constantly evolving and changing. This fundamental architectural advantage
provides customers greater flexibility, faster time to market, and the ability to scale without rearchitecting. These

Q1 2026 Earnings Call 04-Jun-2025
capabilities are why customers continue to develop more and more mission critical workloads in MongoDB
illustrated by our strong customer additions this quarter.
As AI redefines how applications are built and how businesses operate, MongoDB is exceptionally well-
positioned. Real world AI applications require high quality, context rich and often unstructured data to deliver
trustworthy outputs. We continually hear from large enterprises that high accuracy is a critical requirement to drive
wide scale adoption of AI. Our recent acquisition of Voyage AI enhances our ability to serve this need.
Embeddings are the bridge between a large language model and a customer's private data. Voyage's leading
embedding and reranking models allow customers to feed precise and relevant context into LLMs, significantly
improving the accuracy and reliability of the output of AI applications. By producing the most contextually rich
domain optimized embeddings MongoDB sits at a gateway of meaning in an AI system.
With the release of voyage 3.5, we've taken another step forward meaningfully outperforming the next best
embedding models while reducing storage costs by more than 80%. This makes it not only powerful but also cost
effective at scale. So what does this all mean? MongoDB now brings together three things that modern AI
powered applications need, real time data, powerful search and smart retrieval. By combining these into one
platform, we make it dramatically easier for developers to build intelligent, responsive apps without stitching
together multiple systems. And their desire to keep up with evolving customer needs, some vendors are
retrofitting their products such as adding JSON or vector support as afterthoughts, which are superficial and
brittle. This is a tacit admission that MongoDB's approach of using JSON and the docu model is the best way to
model real world data.
These features may check the box, but they fall apart in production, leading to performance bottlenecks,
operational headaches and spiraling infrastructure costs. Fundamentally, these vendors are constrained by the
relational underpinnings. It's important to understand that superficial compatibility with modern data types is not
the same as deeply integrated production grade functionality. MongoDB, by contrast, was purpose built to
address these needs natively.
We see this dynamic in our customer base every day. To bring this to life with an example, Zepto, an India based
quick commerce platform with $1.5 billion in annual sales, migrated to MongoDB from PostgreSQL after
experiencing scalability challenges. Zepto offers users a choice of over 15,000 products with a promised 10-
minute delivery and has grown rapidly since its founding in July 2021, recording 20% month-over-month growth.
After this rapid growth, Zepto faced performance issues with its previous infrastructure powered by PostgreSQL
and Redis clusters that could no longer scale. By migrating to MongoDB Atlas, Zepto overcame these challenges
through built in features like in-memory caching, sharding and real time analytics. This transition enabled them to
reduce latency by 40%, handle 6 times more traffic and improve page load times by 14%, directly enhancing
customer experience and enabling their fast growth.
As we look ahead, we're confident that MongoDB's combination of architectural advantage, enterprise trust and
broad developer adoption positions us to lead us – to lead in both the current wave of digital transformation and
the next wave powered by AI. We also remain focused on our other strategic priorities we've discussed in
previous quarters, moving upmarket and modernizing legacy apps. We're seeing good progress on these
initiatives, which will fuel growth into fiscal 2027 and beyond.
This quarter, we hired a new leader who has nearly 30 years of experience in technology transformation at
leading systems integrators to lead our application modernization program. We continue to see a significant

demand to modernize legacy applications, and we're making great progress on tooling to automate this effort to
standardize and productize this offering.
While we continue to invest in the long-term, we are also sharpening our focus on operating efficiency. We view
this as healthy discipline, regularly reassessing the return on our spend, identify what's working and what's not,
and reallocating resources to high conviction areas and improving profitability.
To help usher in our next stage of growth, I'm delighted to introduce two new leaders to the executive team. Mike
Berry, our new CFO, joins us from NetApp, where he had served in the same role for the past five years. Mike is a
seven-time CFO with over 30 years' experience in technology and software and has a proven track record of
driving profitable growth. We have also promoted May Petry to be our new CMO. May joined MongoDB in early
2022 as VP of Digital and Growth Marketing and brings the right mix of enterprise experience and results
orientation to lead our marketing organization.
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base.
Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects in Atlas, leveraging the full
power of our platform, including the European Commission, Lenovo, Nokia Networks, and CSX. CSX, a leading
US railroad transportation company, migrated its mission-critical railroad transportation operations portal, which is
responsible for real-time monitoring and alerts across 21,000 miles of track and ensuring uninterrupted 24/7
availability onto MongoDB Atlas. CSX can now dynamically scale workloads and optimize the database
management. With this modernization, CSX is positioned to achieve greater operational performance while
driving long-term sustainable growth.
Startups and mature companies are using MongoDB to help to deliver the next wave of AI-powered applications
to their customers, including [ph] Cursor, Helion, Vonage, The Financial Times (00:10:30) and LG U+. LG U+, a
South Korean mobile network operator owned by the LG Corporation, built its agent assist AI solution on
MongoDB Atlas, which supports thousands of agents in accessing information and delivering accurate responses
to customers quickly. They use MongoDB Atlas Vector Search to enable real-time AI capabilities, such as
identifying customer intent and providing guidelines on how to respond to inquiries. The solution has significantly
enhanced customer experiences and decreased the average processing time per call.
In summary, we had a strong Q1 and we remain confident in our ability to execute on a long-term opportunity.
We're steadily advancing toward our vision of becoming the go-to platform for enterprises and the first choice for
developers creating new applications.
Before I turn it over to Mike, I would personally invite you to the Investor Session at the MongoDB.local NYC to be
held at the Javits Center on September 17. Please email ir@mongodb.com if you're interested in attending.
With that, here is Mike.

Michael J. Berry
Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
Thank you, Dev, for that great introduction. I am thrilled to join MongoDB at such an exciting moment in its growth
journey. The company's incredible track record of product innovation and established leadership position in one of
the largest, most strategic markets in software provides significant growth drivers that we expect to benefit our
business for years to come. The opportunity to join a company the caliber of MongoDB was incredibly compelling.
I would like to thank Dev and the entire board for giving me this opportunity. I am extremely excited and look
forward to working alongside the talented team to create long-term value for our customers, shareholders, and

employees. Driving profitable growth with operational excellence and discipline is a priority for the whole
leadership team.
With that said, let's move on to the financial results. I'll begin with a detailed review of our first quarter results and
then finish with our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2026. I will be discussing our results on a non-
GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. In the first quarter, total revenue was $549 million, up 22% year-over-year
and above the high end of our guidance. Shifting to product mix, Atlas grew 26% in the quarter compared to the
year-ago period and now represents 72% of total revenue. This compares to 70% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025
and 71% last quarter.
Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q1, consumption growth was in line with our
expectations. Given the unique macroeconomic backdrop, I will provide some detail on the month-over-month
trends, but please note that I do not expect to give this level of detail going forward. Specifically, we saw a good
consumption growth in February and March, some softness in April as macroeconomic volatility increased,
followed by a healthy rebound in May.
Turning to non-Atlas, revenue came in ahead of our expectations in the quarter as we continued to have success
selling incremental workloads into our existing EA customer base.
Turning to customer growth, during the first quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 2,600
sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 57,100, which is up from over 49,200 in the year ago
period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 55,800
customers at the end of the quarter, compared to over 47,700 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in
mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB, in addition to existing EA
customers deploying workloads on Atlas for the first time.
Of our total customer count, over 7,500 are direct sales customers, relatively flat to last quarter and up 5% year-
over-year. These metrics are largely due to our decision to reallocate a portion of our go-to-market resources from
the mid-market to the enterprise channel starting in the second half of last year. We expect this dynamic will
continue going forward as we capture more mid-market customers with our self-serve motion. In Q1, our net ARR
expansion rate was approximately 119%, which is consistent with recent quarters. We ended the quarter with
2,506 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR, a 17% growth versus the year ago period.
Moving down to the income statement, gross profit in the first quarter was $407 million, representing a gross
margin of 74%, which is down from 75% in the year-ago period. Our year-over-year gross margin decline is
primarily driven by Atlas growing as a percent of the overall business and the impact of the Voyage acquisition.
Our income from operations was $87 million for a 16% operating margin compared to a 7% operating margin in
the year ago period. We are very pleased with our stronger-than-expected operating margin results, which
benefited from our revenue outperformance as well as the timing of expenses, particularly slower-than-planned
head count additions. Net income in the first quarter was $86 million or $1 per share based on 86 million diluted
shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $43 million or $0.51 per share on 83 million diluted shares
outstanding in the year-ago period.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow was $110 million and free cash flow was $106
million in the first quarter, which compares to $64 million and $61 million respectively in the year-ago period. The
strong start for cash flow in fiscal 2026 was driven primarily by strong operating profit results and higher cash
collections.

Q1 2026 Earnings Call 04-Jun-2025
Before turning to our outlook in greater detail, I would like to share the key points driving how we are looking at
the rest of fiscal year 2026. Number one, we are raising our expectations for revenue based on our strong start to
the year. Number two, we are increasing our operating margin guidance by 200 basis points, reflecting an
increased focus on margin improvement. And number three, we are announcing a significant expansion to our
share repurchase program.
I would like to take a minute to provide some color on the share repurchases. Today, we are pleased to announce
that our board of directors has authorized an increase to our share repurchase program under which we may
repurchase up to an additional $800 million of our common stock. Please note this authorization is in addition to
the $200 million buyback the board authorized last quarter to offset the dilutive impact of the Voyage AI
acquisition, bringing the total authorization to $1 billion. This decision reflects our confidence in the long-term
potential of our business and underscores our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders, while
maintaining a flexible capital structure.
I would note that we did not repurchase any shares in Q1 as the CFO search process prevented us from initiating
the repurchase program. It is our intention to begin repurchasing shares in Q2.
Now moving on to our full year guidance, I'd like to provide some incremental comments on our expectations.
First, as we discussed, we had a strong start to the year and feel good about our ability to drive continued
revenue and profitability growth, even with a more uncertain macroeconomic environment. We are raising our full
year revenue guidance by $10 million, which reflects the continued confidence in Atlas, while incorporating some
timing differences in our EA business.
Second, our expectations for non-Atlas subscription revenue have not changed. We continue to expect that we'll
be down in the high-single digits for the year, though we will continue to expect non-Atlas ARR will grow year-
over-year. As a reminder, we expect an approximately $50 million headwind from multi-year license revenue in
fiscal year 2026, primarily impacting the second half of the year.
Finally, we are raising our expectations for operating margin to 12% at the midpoint, up from 10% in our initial
fiscal year guidance. We remain committed to a balanced investment approach that supports our key long-term
growth initiatives. As CFO, one of my key priorities will be working closely with leaders across the business to
identify ways to both reallocate existing spend to higher ROI opportunities and be more disciplined about
incremental spending. We are focused on running an efficient, scalable business that supports growth in revenue
and profitability to drive long-term shareholder value.
Moving on to our Q2 guidance, a few things to keep in mind. First, I want to remind you that Q2 has three more
days than Q1, which is a sequential tailwind for Q2 Atlas revenue. Second, we expect to see high single-digit
year-over-year decline in the non-Atlas business after a stronger-than-expected Q1. And third, we expect
operating margin will be lower than in Q1 as we have invested in targeted areas to drive growth. In addition, the
expected sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue will be a headwind to profitability in Q2.
With that context, I will now turn to our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2026. For the second
quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $548 million to $553 million. We expect non-GAAP income from
operations to be in the range of $55 million to $59 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range
of $0.62 to $0.66 based on 87.5 million estimated diluted shares outstanding.

Q1 2026 Earnings Call 04-Jun-2025
For fiscal year 2026, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $2.25 billion to $2.29 billion, an increase of $10
million from our prior guide. We are raising our non-GAAP income from operations expectations by $57 million
and are now targeting a range of $267 million to $287 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the
range of $2.94 to $3.12 based on 87.6 million estimated diluting shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net
income per share guidance for the second quarter and fiscal year 2026 assumes a non-GAAP tax provision of
approximately 20%.
To summarize, MongoDB delivered strong first quarter results. We are pleased with our ability to drive growth
across the business and increase our operating profitability expectations. We have a small share in one of the
largest and fastest growing markets in all of software with a number of secular tailwinds at our back. We remain
incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead and we'll continue to invest responsibly to drive long-term
shareholder value.
With that, Josh, we'd like to open it up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley.
You may proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjit K. Singh Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. Thank you for taking the question and congrats on the strong Q1 and really nice to see the Atlas growth
accelerating on a days adjusted basis and on a reported basis as well. Dev, I had a question for you and then I
got a question for Mike as well. Dev, to start, when we think about what's driving Atlas growth, can you frame it in
terms of the type of applications that are being built? In your script, you sort of distinguished cloud native,
distributed, real time today versus the AI apps for tomorrow. And so I just love to get a sense of the nature and
style of applications that are being built on MongoDB that's driving this accelerated growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yes. So, Sanjit, thanks for the question. What I would say is that we still talk to customers who have very near
needs for running their business, building new applications to drive operational efficiency, building new products
and services through software to drive to take advantage of new revenue opportunities and to continue to drive
more innovation in their business. I think what people find attractive of MongoDB is that you really can use it for a
wide variety of use cases. You can support very transactional-intensive use cases, you can support more modern
use cases, things like an IoT streaming and so on so forth, as well as being able to also support some of these
more modern use cases like AI.
And the fact that you can do this all at one platform where you don't have to stitch together multiple tools, that the
underlying architecture is designed to really help you model the real world, to be able to handle complex nested
and evolving data, to be able to scale elastically, to be able to run these applications on any cloud, across clouds
or on-prem just makes MongoDB a very attractive solution. And we feel really good about the fact that we add a
lot of customers. So what it really shows is that customers and developers are voting with their feet to really adopt
MongoDB.

highly experienced CFO, this is your seventh stint. But this is a consumption model, right, which has like a more
variable components. So I'd love to see how you're thinking about that as you take on the role from a growth
perspective, but also from an operational discipline perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Berry A
Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. So thank you for the question, Sanjit. It's actually a very interesting one. So I think the company does a
wonderful job actually on the metrics that they give. We had experience in a consumption business at my last role
as well, and going through all the data and meeting with the team in the firehose, that has been my onboarding.
There we have a lot of data. I think that the metrics that we talk to investors about are very relevant in terms of
consumption, in terms of customer growth. So at this point, again, at the non-exclusive, just a fact, eight days in, I
would say not a lot of change there.
I do think that we will spend a lot more time going forward on a couple of things. One is just the capital structure,
the cash flow generation of the business as well as the operating margin improvements. And this will certainly
change. I would also underline, hey, come in September to the MongoDB.local event that will give us – that will
give me at least another quarter under my belt and we'll talk a little bit more about what you can expect from
MongoDB going forward.

Raimo Lenschow Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey. Perfect. Thank you. I had two quick questions. One for Dev, one for Mike. Dev, if you look this week, we saw
Snowflake kind of made the move towards PostgreSQL. We saw Databricks kind of doing something there. Can
you kind of frame that? Because obviously, like from the outset, it looks like there is like a big embrace going on,
but like maybe contrast a little bit like where you fit in and where some of those moves could fit in. And that's my
first question.
And then for Mike, like, I know you have only had eight days, but when you did your due diligence looking on the
company and also looking at the strong performance on the profitability in Q1, like how do you think about this
business? Because it's one of the things that people would have kind of talked with the previous team about is the

profitability level of this, and if there's something inherent there or if there's some things that can be done about
that. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Thanks, Raimo. To your first question, I think the moves by both Databricks and Snowflake, I think, validate one
thing, that OLTP, or the operational data store, is the strategic high ground, especially for AI. That's where
inference happens. Inference is the big market. That's where everyone wants to go. And you need to have an
operational data store to do that. And I think the other thing it points out is building organically an OLTP store is
really hard, especially when you need to meet the requirements of enterprise scale, availability, resiliency, and
security. And both organizations had signaled that they were working on organic approaches. Snowflake talked
about in the store, Databricks have talked about their own organic efforts. And it's clear that they couldn't make it
happen. So this is not an easy task.
The second point I'd make is that just because they're buying a small PostgreSQL companies, I think – and Neon,
I would say was in the byte coding space, and I would say Crunchy Data is a small relational company based in
South Carolina, I would say that it's not clear to me why the world needs a 15th or 16th PostgreSQL derivative
database. I think we'll find that out. And I think there's also some noise about how Neon is – 80% of its instances
are provisioned via code. I should point out that nearly 80% of MongoDB instances on Atlas are provisioned via
code. And so, we do that to help our customers provision and scale clusters very, very quickly.
And so the real advantage is architecture. And we believe that the fact that PostgreSQL and other relational
platforms are now adding JSON is a tacit admission that the core tabular architecture just doesn't get the job done
in the world of AI. And developers need to be able to model the real world data, which is complex, messy, nested,
which means it has highly interdependent relationships and is constantly evolving and changing.
And then when you look at the fact that they've bolted on these capabilities, if you add a document size greater
than 2 kilobytes, it's going to deliver a very poor performance. And so the superficial compatibility does not mean
it's native, does not mean it's production-grade, it does not mean it's designed for enterprises. And so, if the
competition is now and who's going to compete for these complex AI workloads, we welcome that challenge
because architecturally we think we have a huge advantage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Berry A
Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
So, hey, Raimo, it's Mike. So thanks for the question. I would highlight kind of four areas when I did the diligence
on MongoDB, and I can say in the first eight days, nothing has changed my mind on any of these. First of all, hey,
there are few companies that are greater than $2 billion of revenue where their main business is growing 20%-
plus, the total business growing double-digit with 70% plus gross margin. So stop there. That's a scale business
that has a lot of leverage built in. So the three things or the four things I looked at is already had the scale from an
international and from a product perspective. And the main business now is growing very – is 72%, growing very
quickly.
Number two is, this is a business model that has leverage. Because you can bring additional revenue in, it's going
to come through the gross margin line at high margins. That leaves a ton of room for investing in the business, but
also candidly for driving more efficiency as well, and that was the third piece when you look at it and nothing
against the company as it sits today. As we grow, I'm completely confident we can continue to invest in the
business but become more efficient.

And then the fourth part was, hey, it's really nice to come to a business that has a super clean balance sheet and
a bunch of cash on there as well. That leaves a bunch of flexibility going forward. So, all of that I looked at and
said, wow, what a great opportunity. And then of course, I looked at where you folks were valuing the business
and I said, wow, that's a really good opportunity.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Ader with William Blair. You may proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Ader Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Yes. Thank you. Sorry to beat the PostgreSQL horse here, Dev. But my question is, a key part of the bull
narrative for Mongo has been the document databases would steadily take share from relational, and then Mongo
would become the default general purpose database for modern apps. I guess my question is, does the rising
popularity of PostgreSQL among developers and the strong ecosystem it has as we see from Snowflake and
Databricks and what the cloud guys are doing, does that suggest that relational just may have greater long-term
relevance than initially anticipated?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah, Jason, thanks for the question. And I think I want to clarify some of these misconceptions that are out there.
One is that this is a big market. It's a $100 billion-plus market so there can be multiple winners, right. Second, the
PostgreSQL popularity is really a function of the consolidation of the SQL market. People are leaving Oracle,
leaving SQL Server, leaving MySQL and going to PostgreSQL. I think the third thing that I should mention is that
PostgreSQL does have this veneer of being an open source, open standard, not owned by any one vendor. But
there are literally every vendor, including the hyperscalers, have their own version of PostgreSQL that build
proprietary extensions and other capabilities that actually make it very difficult to go from one version of
PostgreSQL to another version of PostgreSQL. With MongoDB, you can actually run any workload on any cloud,
across clouds and on-prem without changing a line of code.
And last I would say architecturally, we are far better optimized for this new world of complex modern
applications, especially in the world of AI. JSON was designed to really address the needs of this modern world,
how data is very messy, how it's very interdependent, how it changes often, there's no predictability in the format.
There's no uniformity on the structure, and MongoDB is designed to handle that world.
And when relational databases start trying to mimic our features, what does that tell you? It tells you that their
existing architecture is not designed for this world. Now there's no question when that technology has been
available for 40, 50 years, there's a large group of people who understand that technology. But we feel we are
well-positioned. We have more work to do, but we feel like well-positioned to be a winner in this next wave of
applications that are being built, and we feel confident about our position.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Ader Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
And just one quick follow-up to that, Dev, thank you for that answer. Should we be thinking about then, I don't
know, over the next five plus years or something that the two big winners in the database market in terms of

architecture will be PostgreSQL sort of for the relational crowd and Mongo for the non-relational crowd. Is that
how we should be thinking about it? Is that how you're thinking about it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. I would say, I definitely think that there will be multiple winners. This is not a zero sum game. I also believe
that the other point I want to clarify is a lot of people compare MongoDB to PostgreSQL and that's actually a false
comparison. By us embedding keyword search, by us embedding a native vector search, by us embedding
embedding models, you're really comparing MongoDB to PostgreSQL plus Elastic plus Pinecone, but something
like Cohere. So the value for customers is that they don't have to stitch all these capabilities together. They get all
these capabilities in a very elegant, natively built way that they can – allows them to move fast. That's not a very
complex architecture and it's much more cost-effective. And so – but I do think there will be multiple winners. And
for people who want to stay on relational, PostgreSQL is a very viable option. But we think that we have a big
opportunity in front of us.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kash Rangan Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs
Yeah. Thank you very much, Dev. One for you and one for you, Mike, congratulations on joining Mango as CFO.
Dev, can you give us a mark-to-market on where we are with some of the growth initiatives you undertook, such
as Relational Migrator, the move upmarket, the reconstitution or the refocusing of the sales force towards higher
value accounts? And I think you have discussed metrics such as the productivity, superiority in moving upmarket.
So – and if you could just not only give us the mark-to-market, but how is that new push showing up in terms of
incremental productivity metrics? Obviously, the customer lines have been quite good, but with respect to growth
rate, it does not look like we're quite yet at that inflection point. Maybe if you could just give us a little bit more of
your introspective analysis on that.
And then, Mike, one for you. You talked about second half dynamic with respect to, I believe, it was the EA
business, can you expand upon that a little bit and what could go right versus that austere assumption? Because
after all, we didn't see upside in EA this particular quarter sort of versus not your guidance, but your predecessor's
guidance? Thank you so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Thanks, Kash. So let me start. So when we talked about the strategic initiatives, we really called out three things.
One, R&D investments, two, moving up market, and three, putting more focus on awareness and education. So
on the R&D investments, I would tell you that we're already seeing returns on investment. We know we said we're
going to double down on the core. We introduced MongoDB 8.0, which is the most performant release we've ever
issued. And I will also point out that it's also had the fastest uptake of any major releases. Customers are adopting
8.0 two times faster than our last major release. We're also expanding our engineering efforts around AI and
Voyage because that's a super exciting area for us and we're also investing in product tooling for around app
monetization.

Q1 2026 Earnings Call 04-Jun-2025
And last but not least, we're bringing in more senior talent to really complement the existing team so that we can
really have a broader ambition. So that investment is paying handsomely. The move up market is also going well
because part of our results are a function of the fact that we made that move starting in the last year and we're
starting to have – do bigger deals. We've signed some very, very large deals with some very, very large
enterprises and the productivity of that team has always been quite high. And I would say a complementary move
is that our self-serve businesses start acquire mid-market logos, serving them more efficiently without ceding
ground to anyone else so and that shows up as you see in our customer count this quarter.
And then in terms of awareness and education, we are aggressively investing in a few areas. One, we're
aggressively investing in the Bay Area. That's where the next-gen AI companies, the next-gen AI developers are
highly concentrated and we're starting to see some traction there. And we have some high profile AI customers
already on our platform and lots of other smaller customers. We are investing in attracting relational developers to
learn more about MongoDB. So we're attending relational conferences, putting together more training and more
skills for people to upskill their abilities and also providing certifications.
And what we also find is lot of the new Atlas registrants are actually new to MongoDB. So we're spending a lot of
time making sure they're onboarded properly and taking full advantage of all our capabilities. And then as part of
the training, we're upskilling developers on modern databases, right? As I mentioned, certifications, self-paced
courses and all that. And we also expanded our documentation to Mandarin, to Portuguese, to Korean and
Japanese, because MongoDB truly has a global business and these developers all around the world want to use
MongoDB. And I think we're just getting started. There's more things we're doing that I just can't talk about right
now around – especially on awareness and education. But the key point is there are some misconceptions about
MongoDB that we know we need to address and we're quite excited about the opportunity to do so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Berry A
Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
So thank you, Kash, for the question. This is Mike and for the kind words. So just for context, as we talked about
in the prepared remarks, so for the full year, we remain confident in the business. If we took Q1, we exceeded our
expectations and we largely rolled the beat from the Atlas business into the full year number. As it relates to non-
Atlas and then specifically your question, we did do – we had a good quarter in the EA business. Some of that
was timing. So we adjusted Q2 through Q4 non-Atlas business to take that into account.
As it relates to the $50 million multi-year headwind you talked about, that's largely due to the renewals and the
timing of those renewals from fiscal 2025. So we have maintained that same guidance to the extent that it could
be better than May, then that would certainly be an upside. Keep in mind, though, that those are renewals based
on when those customers come up. So it's not completely in our control there may be upside, but at this point,
we're still holding to the same guidance.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. You may proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Reback Q
Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great. Thanks very much. Dev last quarter you talked about AI only being modestly incremental to revenue
growth in 2026 here. Is that the same expectation 90 days later?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yes. So what I would say is the following. We see thousands of customers building thousands of apps on
MongoDB and that's growing quarter-over-quarter. We are seeing some high profile, well-known AI companies. I
mentioned Cursor on the call and there are some – a few other high profile companies who are building on top of
MongoDB. And obviously those businesses are really taking off. But what we see is that enterprises are still early
in the adoption of AI. The barriers include there's a limited set of skills and experience with the AI, trust with AI
systems that are probabilistic, which is another way of saying the risk of hallucinations.
And so we see obviously some early use cases around operating efficiency, chatbots, co-gen and domain specific
ISVs like Harvey, but – the customers are using, but – and we've already seen, as I mentioned on the call, LG U+,
we have Swisscom, Novo Nordisk, CentralReach are bunch of customers I mentioned in the past who have
already deployed our AI capabilities. But the real enduring value will come when people start building custom AI
apps.
And the point I want to make is that anyone can use an ISV to run their business, but that doesn't give them a
competitive advantage because their competitors could use the same ISV. What really gives them a competitive
advantage is building custom solutions around using AI to transform their business, whether to seize new
opportunities, to respond to new threats, to drive more operating efficiency. And when people start really learning
about MongoDB, the document model can handle these complex data structures.
We have best-in-class Voyage embeddings to improve the accuracy of these results to help people get
comfortable with using AI. And by integrating tech search, vector search and embeddings and operational data,
that's a unique differentiator. It makes the developer's life easy, reduces cost and complexity. And so we feel
we're well-positioned for this. But it's still early as most enterprises are still early in the adoption of AI.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Reback Q
Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great. And then on the go-to-market side, any meaningful changes on the kind of upper market comp plan that
we should be aware of?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
No meaningful changes. We feel good about what's happening at the high end of the market and we also feel
good about our self-serve business being able to acquire customers more efficiently. So we feel like those
motions are working.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Reback Q

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brent A. Bracelin Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thank you. Good afternoon. Mike, great to hear your voice again here. Welcome aboard. Dev, one of the
challenges that we've had with the story here is that the Atlas business has been decelerating here, moderating
growth for about three years. This was the first quarter where we actually saw Atlas growth reaccelerate, pretty
big step up here in the number of net new Atlas customers. Would you now say you feel like you've kind of
bottomed relative to the growth profile of Atlas and you're kind of now on a newer more stable trajectory going
forward? Just walk me through what looks like a meaningful reversal here in the Atlas business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. So we're very proud of our results in Q1. And much to what Mike mentioned earlier, when you look across
the landscape, there's not many companies who have their core business growing at 26% year-over-year at our
scale, right. Atlas is a very large business. And so there's not many companies who are growing at that rate. And
we feel like the – what's on the horizon in terms of AI, in terms of we – I haven't talked about app modernization,
where we can help customers more efficiently reduce the cost and significantly reduce the time to modernize
legacy applications. That gives us easier access to a large market. And so those are also initiatives that we're
spending a lot of time and investment on, and there's lots of customers who are still need to run their business
and continue to build applications that are core to their business strategy. So we feel good about our opportunity.
Our guide is our guide. We feel good about the quarter. And we also feel great about the fact that our – the
customer adds were very strong this quarter, which shows that people are embracing MongoDB.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brent A. Bracelin Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thanks for that. And then Mike, I know you're eight days in a firehose here, increased focus on margin
improvement reads loud and clear. You did talk about kind of balance sheet. This company does have a lot of
cash. I know you're putting the $1 billion of it to use to the buyback. But other uses of cash, do you see an
opportunity to maybe get a little more aggressive on M&A, small tech tuck-ins to also maybe help accelerate the
AI opportunity, walk me through kind of use of cash. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Berry A
Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
Sure, and thanks for the comments. Great to hear your voice as well. So, hey, on the buybacks, just to hit that,
hey, we're super excited about the board expanding that up to $1 billion and we will be active as it relates to the
buyback. For the rest of the cash, what I'd say is, hey, we feel really good about the organic growth story here,
and that's the focus to the extent that they are smaller tuck-ins or we could do roadmap acceleration and use
some of it, not a lot of it. That's certainly up for debate as well. So, it does give us that option. I would say we don't
think we need to do M&A to achieve our target certainly. But to the extent that we think it can help, it is nice to
have the available cash.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ittai Kidron Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Thanks. Appreciate it. Dev, I want to dig in a little bit into the high-end focus, the large enterprise. Is there any
data you can provide proof points kind of under the surface data points that you're tracking internally about
progress here? Anything about pipeline, number of Fortune 2000 logos? Help me think about the evolution here,
and at what point do you think we'll be at full run rate here on this group?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Well, I will tell you that I think we already have meaningful traction. I think we previously disclosed that 75% of the
Fortune 100 are existing already MongoDB customers, and 50% of the Fortune 500 are MongoDB customers. So,
that tells you that we already have meaningful traction. And what we realize is the biggest opportunity for us is to
expand in those accounts. I just recently had the CIO of one of the largest healthcare companies in the world in
our office. I just met with the senior leadership team from one of the largest financial services companies here in
New York. And then I met another team from another financial services company in New York and they're
bringing us in, saying, we want to have a more strategic relationship with you.
So I feel like the motion is working. We're doing larger deals. Asnd the productivity of the sales team focused on
those accounts is materially higher than the typical sales rep. So we feel like it's a motion that we will invest on for
the long term. And I think the results will obviously speak for themselves, but we feel really good about our move
upmarket. And I also want to point out that our self-serve motion is a nice complement to that move because it
allows us to acquire lower end customers, mid-market customers much more efficiently. So we're not like ceding
ground to anyone in that segment of the market.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ittai Kidron Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Yeah. That's great to see. And Mike, for you, first of all, congratulations and looking forward to working with you. A
couple of small ones. First of all, you talked about the slower than planned head count addition in the quarter. Can
you tell us in what areas and is this going to be an issue down the road in that you're kind of – you're a little bit
behind on head count additions? And also your guidance for the year, you raised it by $10 million, the beat was
greater. Can you tell us when and where are you a little bit more conservative than on the remainder of the year
and what part of your business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Berry A
Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
Sure. So let's take the head count first. So it was really broad-based across the whole team in terms of slower
head count additions. There was nothing that we didn't pull back or say don't hire. It just – it takes longer. So
nothing there. We also don't have any concerns around does that mean lower, for instance, sales capacity largely
due to what Dev talked about on the go-to-market. So, do we think it goes forward, it certainly is a part of us, I

would say, moderating our OpEx expectations for the rest of the year hence the increase, 200 basis points. So
that's the head count piece.
On the beat and raise, so we did beat by $20 million in the quarter. As we talked about, we largely rolled the Atlas
beat into the full year number and left the rest of the year where we were. We felt good about what we guided to
after Q4. Hey, there's a lot of uncertainty as it relates to the world tariffs, the economic situation and everything
else. So, we think it's prudent to leave that guide there. We did come down by $10 million in the non-Atlas
business because that was largely timing. And as we said, we're still holding to the EA forecast that we did on a
year-over-year basis. Now we'll see where that goes. It's also the hardest piece of the business to forecast
because of those larger deals. So we thought that that was the prudent way to guide the year.

Andrew Nowinski Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. Thank you. Maybe I just wanted to follow up on the Atlas guidance. I know you're saying that consumption
was in line with your expectations, but can you just provide any more color on sort of the mechanics of growth in
that consumption segment? Because it would seem that the outperformance in Q1 would set you on a higher
trajectory for the full year due to the fact that it is a consumption model, unless there's some sort of drastic change
in the global economy that would change your customers' consumption patterns.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Berry A
Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
Sure. So, Andrew, it's Mike. So thanks for the question. So, if you take a step back and that's what we saw in Q1,
we talked about the monthly consumption patterns there. We did a little bit better early in the quarter and April
was a little bit soft. The dynamic that you just talked about is exactly what's baked into the guidance for the rest of
the year. We continue to expect Atlas growth to be strong as we go through the year. We are also cognizant of
April was a little bit soft, May pop back, we'd like to see a couple more months of that going into the year.
Hopefully we feel more confident as we go into the second half. But at this point, given all the economic
uncertainty, we certainly hope there is upside, but we'd like to get through another quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Nowinski Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Understood. And Mike, thank you. It's great to reconnect again from our days at NetApp. My second question is
really more at a higher level. I understand the performance and scalability advantages of MongoDB over – or I
should say document database over relational database. But have you maybe thought about or consider herding
sort of feedback from customers as to whether MQL might be simply maybe more difficult for a developer to use
versus SQL and maybe that's why you're seeing sort of this increase in interest in PostgreSQL? Because it's

certainly not a better performing database, I think everyone knows that, but maybe it's just a query language
issue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
So again, thanks for the question. I just want to again say, we're going after a big market. I think the PostgreSQL
popularity is a function of people basically leaving other relational platforms, in particular Oracle, SQL Server, and
MySQL. So that's why you're seeing developers kind of move to PostgreSQL. But I would tell you that
PostgreSQL is a tabular database, much like all relational databases. So then the question you have to ask
yourself is they announced support for JSON. Why did they do that? And what they – they did that because it was
a tacit admission that that architecture just doesn't get the job done in a world that has to deal with data in the real
world, right. Data in the real world is complex.
Data in the real world has a lot of dependencies like I'll give you some examples like, if you want to model the
message that has attachments or reactions or part of a threaded conversation, how do you do that in a structured
table? If you want to deal with adding new fields or new values and all that, how do you, for example, if you have
users who have probably multiple phone numbers, how do you model that quickly? How do you deal with nested
structures, right, where a customer record could have include past orders, each with their own line items and
order history like how do you do that with a – it's much more difficult where you can model that so much more
easily in MongoDB. How do you deal with like messy inconsistent data that there's no uniformity to. And so we
recognize that some people who don't know MongoDB may not really understand all these advantages, which is
why we're putting more emphasis on awareness and education.
But fundamentally, if you see why these relational databases are adding JSON support, it is acknowledgment that
their existing architecture cannot evolve to – natively evolve to serve these new needs and that's why we think
we're well-positioned, because MongoDB is a native JSON database, it's a document database and it's
distributed. It has – is designed to scale. And the latest release is the most performed release, we're even more
excited about 8.1 that's coming out soon. We acquired Voyage that's going to be natively part of the platform.
We're going to – later this month, we'll enable people to seamlessly generate embeddings from data sitting inside
MongoDB and that will be in private preview.
So that's within four months of the acquisition. So we're moving fast, we're innovating quickly. And that doesn't
even mention a core vector search engine as well as our keyword search engine. So when you put all these
things together, it becomes a very compelling platform. But we recognize that some customers and some users
just don't understand all these things and that's what we're focused on addressing.

Mike Cikos Q
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. Mike, just to come back to the monthly trends that you guys saw
on the Atlas consumption side, and I really, really appreciate all the color there. If you're talking about this
rebound that we saw in May, and I know we don't see like consumption growth year-on-year or usage growth

year-on-year to the detail that you do. But is that year-on-year growth in consumption in May, back to the levels
that we saw in February or March? Or is it still lagging based on that April softness that you had described?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Berry A
Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
So it's much more consistent with what we saw in February and in March. April was a little bit softer. And then, as
we said, it was a healthy rebound in May.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Cikos Q
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks for that. And then, Dev, just one for you. I know that we have some of these go-to-market changes.
I'm looking at the new logos that you added this quarter specifically. And I mean, you guys have been – you have
been native JSON database, you have been that NoSQL vendor. Can you help me think about like why are we
seeing this meaningful bump in the new logos acquired this quarter specifically? It really looks like the self-serve
is taking off. But just interested in what you're seeing on that front. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, you have to remember, our self-serve business was a new skill that we developed frankly
organically here and then actually May Petry, who's been promoted to CMO of the company was the one who led
our self-serve business since early 2022. She and her team had really done a great job of really growing that
business, being much more sophisticated in running experiments, how to attract the right level of customers and
that is showing up in the numbers.
And so – and as we move upmarket, we want to take advantage of that self-serve capability to be able to acquire
more customers in the mid-market. And so that's something that we're going to do. And so we feel really good
about the combination of our direct salesforce as well as our self-serve business in terms of how we approach the
market. And I would say that when we are able to get in front of customers, explain our differentiation, customers
understand and want to use MongoDB. Our biggest challenge is making sure people really understand the
differentiation and don't have certain misconceptions of what we do or what others do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Cikos Q

Well, thank you for joining our call. First of all, I would like to thank Mike, eight days in, it's obviously preparing for
earnings call is hard work and to do it in eight days is pretty impressive. So I really appreciate everything he's
done to prepare for the call today. Again, we had a strong quarter with a record total customer net additions.
We're raising our revenue and operating margin guidance for the full year. We're moving forward with $1 billion
total share repurchase program reflecting our confidence in the business and a commitment to delivering value to
shareholders. And we're more excited than ever about our long-term outlook, particularly our position to
fundamentally address the needs of workloads in both today's era and tomorrow's era driven by AI. So thank you
very much for the call and we'll talk to you soon.

So, you want to hear a short story before we get into this meat of AI and data analytics discussion? The
timeframe is 1985 to 1989. I know he looks really, really young. But the timeframe is 1985 to 1989. Two guys go
to school on either side of the same street, one, and you will guess who it is that I'm talking about and you will
guess who the other person equally importantly. One person studies computer science at the top ranked college
in India, which is possibly freakishly hard to get in. The other guy settles for maybe a top 10 school, but
mechanical engineering, because cannot figure out this computer science stuff.
This other guy, it's becoming very evident who this other guy is, tries to program on an IBM 360 mainframe punch
card, gets his syntax wrong in a Fortran program the first time he ever tried to program, said I'm never going to do
anything to do with computer science ever in my life. In the meantime, this other person not really gets a degree
in computer science, but goes on to get a Ph.D. and goes on to run a company, a tech company. I guess by now
you know who the two are. And so, very proud to call you somebody that I did not even know. But I never knew
that somebody from the other side of the street...

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Q
So, let's talk about what is your vision for Snowflake in the next four years to five years? You've got a rich
background. You're off to a great start. You're firing on all cylinders. The company is rejuvenated. It feels like it's
breathing another dimension of life in its relevance and its core and the opportunities. So, not to put you on the
spot, where are you going with this in the next four to five years?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. For the past 10 years, data has been at the center of many companies, but mostly in the context of how do
we do it more efficiently. CIOs cared about it. And all of a sudden, with the advent of AI, people are increasingly
realizing that high-quality data is going to be at the center of how they transform their enterprise. That's our
aspiration; to help enterprises realize their full potential with data and AI. And all companies start with a certain
history.
We came off history as an analytic platform, and what we are doing and it's an ongoing process is to become an
all-encompassing data platform from inception when data was first born, to insights, that sort of feedback into how
systems should operate. And AI is both a consumption layer, you can get the information faster. It's also a
massive accelerant of the value creation cycle, and that's what we aspire to be.
It's an exciting time to be at the center of data and AI, but I joke to people, that actual mainstream journalists ask
me questions about things like Iceberg, like really open format, but I think it is a reflection of the times that we live
in, how much AI is changing our world and the role that data is going to play in driving that change.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Got it. I wanted to ask you, you've had a rich background at IBM. You ran the ads business, EVP of Ads. What
about that experience has informed you better to be able to run a company, Snowflake?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
I'd say two things. One is sort of an intuitive understanding of the power of data when it comes to creating great
systems. Google was exceptionally lucky that it landed on a business model that, at its core, both in search and in
3
1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2025 FactSet CallStreet, LLC

Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference 08-Sep-2025
ads, was a feedback loop. Search, as all of you know, came of age with the PageRank, which we can think of as
the feedback loop of popularity. You are a great page. You have a bunch of other great pages pointed to you.
Similarly with search ads, I would drive our advertisers crazy when they ask me, what should I put in my ad to
make sure that people click on it and convert on my site? And my genuine answer would be, well, I don't know,
but if you put the right things, we'll make sure you show your ads, because the feedback loop would pick that up.
To me, that's a – and everything that we did in aid of that. We built some amazing streaming systems back in
2005 because you needed that to support that kind of scale. And it's very much infrastructure as an enabler of
massive business outcome. That's the early part of my career. And the latter parts of my career were then about
how do you wield an actual incredibly large business through tons of change. The mobile change was terrifying
for Google because query growth on desktop, which was the driver of our revenue increases, had pretty much
flattened out by 2009, and things like the mobile revolution were still a twinkling sort of in our eye. It had not really
exploded how we made the transition. What it took to steer companies through very large internal transformations
off their business, was also a particularly profound lesson.
And it's the combination of these two, the power of technology to change the course of businesses combined with
what does it take to run a large business and navigate through change moments that feel incredibly daunting.
Mobile was terrifying because that was the only place where we saw growth and mobile queries made one-tenth
the revenue that desktop queries did. But it's the confidence that comes out of being able to navigate through
changes like that.
And at Snowflake, the thing that I tell our customers, CEOs that I talked to, is we want to bring world-class
technology in data that can let them compete on an even playing field with the giants, with the Googles and Metas
of the world, and that's how easy we want to make our technology relevant and applicable to our enterprise
customers, especially in this era of just massive, massive change.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
So, the core of Snowflake data analysis, the old world investors would say that's data warehousing. So, this is
data warehousing the cloud. I'm sure you have a different view and a different frame with which you view your
market opportunity. How different is that frame with which you view the opportunity and why is it so? Why is the
conventional wisdom that it's a data warehousing company with a limited TAM in the cloud so wrong?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. Because platforms evolve over time. And what used to be ""just data warehousing"" became an incredibly
scalable analytic platform in the cloud that could also do machine learning, so that you could begin to feed the
value of that data back into systems. Disney, for example, uses us to optimize guest experience when people are
visiting in their park, also from your data warehouse. And part of what we did was turn this data warehouse into a
collaboration platform. Companies like Fidelity went away from doing literally hundreds of IT integrations, bringing
in files via FTP and SFTP as EtaPRO and a process as possible to collaboration comes out of the box and can
deliver business value like with a couple of screens, as opposed to needing to run an IT project. It is the accretion
of this functionality.
More recently, we have expanded pretty significantly, thanks to Iceberg and Snowpark, into data engineering; and
all of a sudden, the power of Snowflake's core IT, which is the data platform, can now be applied to data that is

outside Snowflake. And to me, the value comes from the addition of all of these pieces, but we are now beginning
to add both data ingestion platforms but also transactional support to things like Unistore and Postgres.
And then on the other side with Snowflake Intelligence, which is our agentic platform, the sum of the pieces is all
of a sudden a whole lot more than the individual pieces. And think about it, a hyperscaler, the Kubernetes
platform plus cloud storage and a bit of networking. And yet these are trillion-dollar companies. To me, it's that
power with data center that we are able to tap. Yeah. Our origins, which by the way, we are not ashamed of, we
are proud of is that infinitely scalable data warehouse on the cloud. But many things can come out of it if you add
the right things into it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
We had Summit, your conference back in June. It felt like it was not a technology company conference, in a good
way. It felt something bigger. There was a bit of sensationalism [indiscernible] (10:21) like an AI conference. You
had Sam Altman, you had all these...

A big shareholder.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q
It's been three months since Summit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
As you reflect upon the products that were announced, as you see through the customer conversations, what is
coming back as one or two products that we've really hit it and that's got a big future? Does anything become
apparent to you? Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
I mean, first of all, we announced lots of things at Summit. But in many, many ways, the mentality that I've put
with our product team is it's a culmination moment. It's not a try and cram everything into one point in time
moment. I just feel like we are living in an era where planning for one or two days in a year is just like not that
smart until we are very iterative. But in terms of products that show incredible promise, I would put Snowflake
Intelligence right up on top. It's an agentic platform. Our sales force is internally at Snowflake a good number of
them are using it. We are rolling it out to everyone. And in brief, what it does is, on my phone, it gives me access
to all of the sales information that we have, our customers, our prospects, how much they've been consuming,
what kind of use cases they have active, and the account hierarchy. All of that information, even attainment
information is there in one place. It's all permission, so that I see a view that's very different from what an account
exec are and SC can see.

To me, it's an indication of what the future world of data access and data manipulation is going to look like.
Honestly, I can ask questions off of it that I would not have dreamed of doing even six months ago, or I've had to
go to an analyst who would then have to work for a day or two to answer these questions. I think it has
remarkable promise. We're in the process of scaling it, so I don't have great revenue numbers to report, but that
very much feels like a before and after a moment in terms of what can you do with data that's in Snowflake.

Can you give us the most resonant use cases for each of these products, not within Snowflake that you already
talked about.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
When you talk to your customers, what are the best examples that you're hearing about how these two products
are lighting up the account base?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. AISQL, for those of you that don't know, essentially introduce some AI primitives into SQL itself. So, when
you think about summing up, let's say, revenue numbers by region to come up with an aggregate, you can also
think about, let's say, taking customer feedback and organizing it by product category, but summarizing the top
feedback using an AI aggregate function. It's super technical. But on the other hand, what this lets people do is
use the power of AI on huge volumes of data without needing to figure out things like, well, how much capacity do
I need? How is that going to be configured? How do I handle failures instead of doing all of that stuff? We take
care of all of that data processing for you. Customers 100% use that to do a lot of sentiment feedback on
feedback that's coming from customers. We just make a whole lot of these kinds of use cases trivial.
It's no longer some complex pipeline or process that you have to set up and run. Snowflake Intelligence, the kind
of solutions that, again, resonate. BlackRock, for example, is creating a customer 360 with it. A lot of customers
BlackRock is one of them have substantial amount of data set within Snowflake. Some are structured, some are
also unstructured, something that'll surprise you folks that are used to thinking about Snowflake as a structured
data company is people routinely store customer feedback, customer conversations. AI companies actually store
things like model responses text. At Snowflake fields, we support these columns called variant types that can hold

a huge amount of data. All of a sudden, you can get a single view with the thinking model deciding, should I be
looking at feedback, should I be looking at the current account balance? As a customer service person, what am I
allowed to see, what am I not allowed to see?
All of that stuff that's taken care of, it's use cases like that that are resonating can be health solutions similar kind
of product now built with clinician notes on top of health data. It is that one-stop-shop access to a ton of
information, context around it, and an agent loop that can decide which tool to call when. That's the resonance.
What I tell people, and I'm sure everyone in the room at this point has used things like ChatGPT or Gemini, Deep
Research, and what I tell people Snowflake Intelligence is, it is ChatGPT, Deep Research with access to all of the
datasets that matter to you. It's the same kind of agent loop to arrive at answers to a question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
That drives up consumption. You find more use cases, more applications to use the platform plus more
consumption?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
That's right. That's right. That's a consequence. I'm actually very proud of the consumption model in here because
it removes a lot of angst from our customers. The first worry that, especially with all of the articles flying left and
right about 95% of projects not doing well this that is what does this mean for how much I am going to be
spending. What I can confidently tell our customers is you don't spend unless people use the product and get
value from it. If something that you build gets no consumption, well, then there's no money to pay. I think that's
what is helpful. And as a company, we also stress, starting from customer value with consumption as a
consequence rather than [indiscernible] (16:59).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Yeah. Got it. Trying to – let me see if I can try to ramp-up consumption by introducing this particular product. No, I
get that. Let's talk about data integration. You said it opens up a massive TAM with the most recent earnings
conference call. You also made an acquisition of a company called Datavolo. Then when I went around the
booths at Snowflake Summit, people are buzzing about your new branded product.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
So, tell us more about why this could be a big opportunity and how you go to market because this is a separate
product and the core engine or maybe there is some adjacency?

Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference 08-Sep-2025
Well, first of all, part of what Snowflake does is it creates an integrated product. This often ends up taking time for
us, which irritates our sales teams and our product managers. They've gotten better at it, but there's only one
Snowflake SKU that comes with everything. It comes with AI and it comes with OpenFlow. It's an important
structural advantage.
What OpenFlow enables is just this ability to be able to connect to different kinds of systems and bring data over
to Snowflake or to Cloud Storage. It's a lot of connectors. We also have partners do this. We don't see this as an
either/or, but many of our customers end up liking the fact that again it's a one-stop-shop that is not a new
contract design or a new tool to figure out. And 100%, I think this makes it much easier to bring data on a periodic
basis into Snowflake and from there starts data engineering. There can be analytic workflows that are built on top
of it and, obviously, access via AI.
So we think of this as a very good addition. We also acquired this company called Crunchy. It's a Postgres
database. The idea again is very simple. Lots of our customers want to build applications that host transactional
data within Snowflake. We want to make it super painless for them to create these Postgres instances. Postgres
has become the de facto standard for OLTP databases, and we feel these just significantly expand our TAM,
while keeping the product pretty cohesive.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Got it. And I wanted to ask you one more product question then go to market. The Snowpark connector for Spark
workloads...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
You kind of brushed over it on the earnings conference call and tried to get at it in the follow-up. It's okay. Tell us
– what can you tell us more about – it is something this opportunity to run Spark workloads on Snowflake, it's
been there for some time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Did you just formalize it through a hardened connector? And so, there is a real opportunity ahead of it. Tell us
more about what's ahead on that side.

Yeah. I mean, we have always aspired to do data engineering workloads. In fact, it is a significant part of
Snowflake's business, but it has also been very Snowflake-centric, meaning it was always, step one, bring data
into Snowflake and then do data engineering on top of it. What Iceberg, which is the interoperable format, unlock
for us is all of the data that is sitting on cloud storage that can now be acted upon by Snowflake. And the other
learning that we have had is that, over time, de facto standards form and Spark is one such standard for data
processing.
And what Spark Connect does is it makes it super easy to run spark jobs without needing to translate anything
right inside Snowflake. Snowflake's performance as the data processing engine is the best that there is out there.
This just makes it easier. And it is also a little bit of us meeting our customers where they want to be. Let's face it,
people do not want to run – like, do custom stuff to be able to run Spark code, this just makes it a whole lot easier.
It unlocks more for us, but it's very much getting started in this area. I think OpenFlow fully rolling out, Spark
Connect fully rolling out is what is going to unlock data engineering in a very big way for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Is this a different opportunity that has opened up that you might need a different sales motion to go after these
unmanaged Spark workloads, et cetera?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
I mean, we have a pretty...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
The value proposition is slightly different in unstructured data.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah, 100%. We have a good formula now for how we take new products to market, which is we hire a small
specialist team. They go create a set of like the early win marquee use cases that show that we can get great
things done. And then we figure out what is the scale motion. For AI, for example, we decided to actually have a
bigger specialist team for special AI use cases. But, on the other hand, we also did enough enablement so that
the broad field sales team can do many simple AI use cases.
At the end of the day, it's not rocket science to be able to build a chatbot, either on structured or unstructured
information, the simple one. The more complicated use cases, yes, is going to require the specialist folks. I think
we are increasingly getting better at being flexible about what is needed to take a new product to market. As a
little bit of applying this recipe, all of you folks that have dealt with enterprise companies know that specialist
motions can take a life of their own, and we want to be careful about how we do it. But, Mike Gannon, our new
CRO, has a ton of experience for when do you spin something up and when do you drive it broadly across the
field so that you don't end up with like five overlays that are as large as your actual sales team. We feel good
about the motion.

Got it. On that, so it's a perfect transition to GTM. What have you unlocked on the go-to-market side with the
hiring of Gannon? And as you build your sights towards what at least we think is a $10-plus billion revenue
company, how do you see GTM changing? The product engineering is there, where you got all of a sudden 18
months a flurry of new products. What needs to change or be enhanced on the go-to-market side that you can get
to the – going from $1 billion to $5 billion is hard.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Very few do it, and you're there, $5 billion to $10 billion, it's [ph] different view (23:13), $10 billion to $20 billion
even so. How do you go to $10 billion and what are your sights beyond $10 billion if you do have sites beyond
$10 billion?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, first of all, I think go-to-market has evolved a lot in the last 18 months. Mike's arrival is a welcome
addition to the team. But in terms of stuff that we've been working on, I've talked about how we are now a lot more
quantitative about the consumption lifecycle. We track use cases pretty carefully. There's even more work to
standardize, what are use cases and how do you measure incremental consumption from it. The core proposition
is you can only optimize what you measure. This is something that all of us can relate to, and so we've gotten
much better at that. And then to the level of sophistication of what's the difference between a 90th percentile
account, our sales rep, and the 50th from like the median.
And another big important change that Mike has also pushing is the role of our solution engineers. We got this
amazing person from Microsoft who's run large portions of their solution engineering team in Azure to run our
team and now our fully...

Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference 08-Sep-2025
Thankfully not. But our solution engineering folks now have much more of they're the leaders of consumption. And
in fact, part of what we have done is make the role of the account execs versus the solution engineers that [ph]
OpCo equal one (24:49) where the account execs talk about things like deals on the earlier stages of the use
case lifecycle while the [ph] SE (24:57) leaders step up and talk about how we are driving consumption, how they
are driving go-live. It's a big change forward with an intimate understanding of what does it mean for somebody to
be productive week on week, month on month, quarter on quarter. I think it just gives us a lot more flexibility about
where we invest.
Similar to ads, my attitude is I'm just a portfolio manager. I'm just looking for the efficient frontier when it comes to
figuring on where do I want to put sales head count. You're putting a lot of it. We hired 800 people in the first half
of this year just into that function.
The second big change that Mike is busy pushing is a rebooted partnership approach. Most of Snowflake gets
delivered via solutions like system integrator partners, GSIs definitely. They are undergoing a world of change
with AI, and we think we have products that can let them demonstrate value a whole lot faster. We hired a new
head of partners as well from AWS. That's a huge focus for Mike. And I think these are the things, combined with
the specialist motion for taking new products to market, I think these are the key ingredients that will let us go
from the $5 billion over to the $10 billion.
Look, we are very, very – first of all, we are early in the on-prem to cloud migration cycle. And AI has now given a
powerful reason for every CIO to now tell their CEO that having great data, having data in Snowflake, is what is
going to drive transformation for your business. So, we feel like AI can be a big pull for how data is brought into
Snowflake. And that's the thing that's going to drive us, first of all, faster to the $10 billion that we want to get to.
But we'll end up creating a much larger TAM as well that we will continue to aspire to.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Got it. One of the thing I wanted to ask you is I know that you spent quite a bit of time at a big technology
company, and you've had a fascinating chance to watch the foundation model battle, which seemed like it was a
two-horse race then became a three-horse race and a four-horse race and five and six. Some people think it's
race to the top. It looks like a race to the bottom. More competition coming in, equal amounts of – not equal, but
surprisingly how quickly it takes for somebody coming from behind to catch up. Why are these models all doing
the same thing? How does it all end if you have a perspective? And where is the next value realization from this
model [indiscernible] (27:44) where are we going as an industry? We've not seen much business return.

Yeah. Oh, well, it is to predict early and predict often. It's just this stuff is just really, really hard. And while it is the
case that some folks like Grok have come from behind and magically caught up, there are plenty of other trillion-
dollar companies that are trying and not quite making it. So, I think there is absolutely a little bit of a je ne sais
quoi to who are the great AI companies. It's not all that easy to compete.
I think the word is like very much still to be written in terms of how this world is going to transpire. And the other
thing that I'll tell people is that, honestly, yes, there's a lot of success with AI, but if you think about what are the
two super hits with AI, it is coding agents and it's ChatGPT, it's consumer chat. Everything else is pretty small in
sort of the big scheme of things. So, my rough take is it's still pretty early.
I think we will see the impact on our personal lives, on enterprises, just it's going to take a few years, it's going to
be gradual. And my take is that so much technology has already been invented that if it truly permeates the world,
say, the way that mobile phones did in terms of the reach that they finally have; what, six billion, seven billion
people in the world, I think it's actually going to be transformational for society. So, this is without taking into
account things like AGI. So, in that sense, I'm very optimistic about how much value can be created with AI. And I
think it's still pretty early. And if I were to bet, I would bet that it is not a unipolar or a bipolar world, that there are
several people with great capabilities. Is that going to get commoditized down to zero? I don't think so either,
because it is truly, truly difficult to kind of be at the cutting edge and it's more than money. I think that's what is
going to keep some of these companies unique. And you folks, again, know this already. OpenAI has run off with
its consumer attention. People are not going to change all that quickly over to a new app unless it is significantly
better. So, I think there are some things that have absolutely been established that are going to be much harder
to break down compared to others.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Got it. Right on the heels of this presentation is going to be a venture capital panel. So, these folks, I'm going to
be asking the same question; and I've been doing that panel with these guys for about 10-plus years. We're going
to call it even better than the all-in podcast, because that's how high the quality of this venture capital panel is. It
really is. If you have a couple of minutes, you should watch it.
The other stat that was very interesting was 50% of your new customer wins in the quarter were attributed to the
AI.

Tell us more about that factor.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
I mean, look, every customer that's betting on Snowflake is betting on the next 10 years. And it's already very
clear that AI is a big part of whatever it is that's going to show up in the next five years. And this is where our
ability to make AI simple for our reps to be able to say, let me show you what is possible with data on Snowflake
become such a big deal. And so, it also points to the importance that AI is going to have in the future. Another stat
that we released as part of earnings was that something like a quarter of deployed use cases have some element
of AI in them. So, I think this points to both the ease of use that Snowflake AI has, but it's increasingly important
for the entirety of the data lifecycle.

Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
What is your prediction for software?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Software is not dead, first of all. I think there is a view that maybe I'm a tired old -despite the fact that I could not
execute my Fortran program on an IBM 360 mainframe back in college, when you are blazing new trails just a
mile away from me, I do believe that we can confuse the user interface and how attractive AI makes it to be to
visualize a complete disruption of the software stack. And I think what's going on is when Netscape went public
and four years after that, the web browser became the new fascination at the front end...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

That's right.

Q
...and the enterprise software industry used the web browser as the front end to re-visualize the way in which end
users interacted with the software. The back end logic did not necessarily change. The back end logic, the logic of
doing business is the logic of doing business that's expressed in code. But what it did do was to help you rip out
the user interaction model. And the same way I think AI is the new UI, it does not change the logic. Certain things
don't need – you don't fix things that are not broken, but we know what's broken, that engagement model, the
front end, and I think many of us confuse, not me, not you, but many confuse the lack of usability or the
complexity of the user interface to be an inherent flaw with the software. And I would beg to disagree. So, I'm
extremely optimistic about how so. Now, there are a lot of cross-currents.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
You guys have emerged from this period of declining any, now you finally had stability and starting to see
improvement. The same thing needs to happen to the rest of the software cohorts. And if I have to say the
software prints, actually all – most of them looked better than expected and showed some sequential
acceleration. So, I am very, very bullish.

GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today
to be appropriate assumptions.
Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including: fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and
spending, including the impact of recessionary fears; inflation; interest rates; regional labor market constraints;
world events; the rate of growth of the Internet; online commerce; cloud services; and new and emerging
technologies and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions,
restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and
therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
And now I'll turn the call over to Andy.

Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $187.8 billion in revenue, up 10% year-over-year. Given the way the dollar
strengthened throughout the quarter, we saw $700 million more of foreign exchange headwind than we
anticipated in guidance. Without that headwind, revenue would have been 11% year-over-year and exceeded the
top end of our guidance.
Operating income was $21.2 billion, up 61% year-over-year, and trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for
equipment finance leases was $36.2 billion, up $700 million year-over-year. We're pleased with the invention,
customer experience improvements and results delivered in 2024 and have a lot more planned in 2025.
I'll start by talking about our Stores business. We saw a 10% year-over-year revenue growth in our North America
segment and 9% year-over-year in our International segment, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates.
Our continued focus on expanding selection, lowering prices, and improving convenience drove strong unit
growth that even outpaced our revenue growth. We continue to add to our broad range of selection, giving
customer's choice across a variety of price points.
We welcomed notable brands to our stores throughout 2024, including Clinique, Estée Lauder, Oura Rings, and
Armani Beauty. We continue to add to the hundreds of millions of products offered from our selling partners who
made up 61% of items that we sold in 2024, our highest annual mix of third-party seller units ever.
We also launched Amazon Haul for US customers in Q4, which offers customers an engaging shopping
experience that brings ultra low-priced products into one convenient destination. It's off to a very strong start.
Customers continue to want Amazon to be the place they rely on for sharp pricing. In the fourth quarter,
consumers saved more than $15 billion with our low everyday prices and record-setting events during the Prime
Big Deal Days in October and Black Friday and Cyber Monday around Thanksgiving. Additionally, Profitero's
annual pricing study found that entering the holiday season, Amazon had the lowest online prices for the eighth
year in a row, averaging 14% lower prices on average than other leading retailers in the US.
Our speed of delivery continues to accelerate, and 2024 was another record-setting year for Prime members. We
expanded the number of same-day delivery sites by more than 60% in 2024, which now serve more than 140
metro areas. And overall, we delivered over 9 billion units the same or next day around the world.

Our relentless pursuit of better selection, price and delivery speed is driving accelerated growth in Prime
membership. For just $14.99 a month, Prime members get unlimited free shipping on 300 million items off of the
same day or 1-day delivery, exclusive shopping events like Prime Day, access to a vast collection of premium
programming and live sports on Prime Video, ad-free listening of 100 million songs and podcasts with Amazon
Music, access to unlimited generic prescription for only $5 a month, unlimited grocery delivery on orders over $35
from Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh for $9.99, a month, a free Grubhub+ membership with free
unlimited delivery, and our latest benefit of a $0.10 per gallon fuel discount at BP Amoco and ampm stations.
When you think about this as a whole and also compared to many other membership services that are
comparably and more expensively priced that offer just one benefit like video, Prime is a screaming deal, and we
have more coming for our Prime members in 2025.
We also remain squarely focused on cost to serve in our fulfillment network, which has been a meaningful driver
of our increased operating income. We've talked about the regionalization of our US network. We've also recently
rolled out our redesigned US inbound network. While still in its early stages, our inbound efforts have improved
our placement of inventory so that even more items are closer to end customers.
Ahead of Black Friday in November, we'd improved the percentage of order units available in the ideal building by
over 40% year-over-year. We've also spent considerable time optimizing the number of items we send customers
in the same package, which reduces packaging, is more convenient for customers, and less expensive for us to
fulfill. And our per unit transportation costs continued to decline as we build out and optimize our last mile
network.
Overall, we've reduced our global cost to serve on a per unit basis for the second year in a row, while at the same
time increasing speed, improving safety and adding selection.
As we look to 2025 and beyond, we see opportunity to reduce costs again as we further refine inventory
placement, grow our same-day delivery network, and accelerate robotics and automation throughout the network.
In advertising, we remain pleased with the strong growth on a very large base, generating $17.3 billion of revenue
in the quarter and growing 18% year-over-year. That's a $69 billion annual revenue run rate, more than double
what it was just four years ago at $29 billion.
Sponsored Products, the largest portion of ad revenue, are doing well and we see runway for even more growth.
We also have a number of newer streaming offerings that are starting to become significant new revenue
sources.
On the streaming video side, we wrapped up our first year of Prime Video ads, and we're quite pleased with the
early progress and head into this year with momentum. We've made it easier to do full funnel advertising with us.
Full funnel is from the top of the funnel with broad reach advertising that drives brand awareness to mid-funnel
responsive brands that companies specify certain keywords and audiences to attract people to their detailed
pages or brand store on Amazon, to bottom of the funnel, where Sponsored Products help advertisers service
relevant product ads to customers at the point of purchase. We make this easy for brands to sign up for and
deploy across our growing advertising.

We also have differentiated audience features that leverage billions of customer signals across our stores and
media destinations. From Amazon Marketing Cloud secure clean rooms providing advertisers the ability to
analyze data, produce core marketing metrics and understand how their marketing performs across various
channels to our new multi-touch attribution model that helps advertisers understand how their marketing is
working.
If an advertiser uses streaming TV, display Sponsored Products and other ad types in their campaign, multi-touch
attribution will show the relative contribution of each to their sales.
Moving on to AWS. In Q4, AWS grew 19% year-over-year and now has a $115 billion annualized revenue run
rate. AWS is a reasonably large business by most folk's standards, and though we expect growth will be lumpy
over the next few years as enterprise adoption cycles, capacity considerations and technology advancements
impact timing, it's hard to overstate how optimistic we are about what lies ahead for AWS's customers and
business.
I spent a fair bit of time thinking several years out. And while it may be hard for some to fathom a world where
virtually every app has Generative AI infused in it, with inference being a core building block just like compute,
storage and database, and most companies having their own agents that accomplish various tasks and interact
with one another, this is the world we're thinking about all the time. And we continue to believe that this world will
mostly be built on top of a cloud with the largest portion of it on AWS.
To best help customers realize this future, you need powerful capabilities in all 3 layers of the stack. At the bottom
layer for those building models, you need compelling chips. Chips are the key ingredient in the compute that
drives training and inference. Most AI compute has been driven by NVIDIA chips, and we obviously have deep
partnership with NVIDIA and will for as long as we can see into the future. However, there aren't that many
Generative AI applications of large scale yet.
And when you get there, as we have with apps like Alexa and Rufus, cost can get steep quickly. Customers want
better price performance and it's why we built our own custom AI silicon. Trainium2 just launched at our AWS
re:Invent Conference in December. And EC2 instances with these chips are typically 30% to 40% more price
performant than other current GPU-powered instances available. That's very compelling at scale.
Several technically-capable companies like Adobe, Databricks, Poolside and Qualcomm have seen impressive
results in early testing of Trainium2. It's also why you're seeing Anthropic build their future frontier models on
Trainium2. We're collaborating with Anthropic to build Project Rainier, a cluster of Trainium2 UltraServers
containing hundreds of thousands of Trainium2 chips. This cluster is going to be five times the number of exaflops
as the cluster that Anthropic used to train their current leading set of cloud models.
We're already hard at work on Trainium3, which we expect to preview late in 2025 and defining Trainium4
thereafter. Building outstanding performant chips that deliver leading price performance has become a core
strength of AWS's, starting with our Nitro and Graviton chips in our core business and now extending to Trainium
and AI, and something unique to AWS relative to other competing cloud providers.
The other key component for model builders is services that make it easier to construct their models. I won't
spend a lot of time in these comments on Amazon SageMaker AI, which has become the go-to service for AI
model builders to manage their AI data, build models, experiment and deploy these models, except to say that
SageMaker's HyperPod capability, which automatically splits training workloads across many AI accelerators,

prevents interruptions by periodically saving checkpoints, and automatically repairing faulty instances from their
last saved checkpoint and saving training time by up to 40%. It continues to be a differentiator.
Received several new compelling capabilities at re:Invent, including the ability to manage costs at a cluster level
and prioritize which workloads should receive capacity when budgets are reached and is increasingly being
adopted by model builders.
At the middle layer, for those wanting to leverage frontier models to build GenAI apps, Amazon Bedrock is our
fully managed service that offers the broadest choice of high-performing foundation models with the most
compelling set of features and make it easy to build a high-quality Generative AI application.
We continue to iterate quickly on Bedrock announcing Luma AI, poolside and over 100 other popular emerging
models to Bedrock at re:Invent. In short order, we also just added DeepSeek's R1 models to Bedrock and
SageMaker. And additionally, we delivered several compelling new Bedrock features at re:Invent, including
prompt caching, intelligent prompt routing and model distillation, all of which help customers achieve lower cost
and latency in their inference.
Like SageMaker AI, Bedrock is growing quickly and resonating strongly with customers. Related, we also just
launched Amazon's own family of frontier models in Bedrock called Nova. These models compare favorably in
intelligence against the leading models in the world but offer lower latency, lower price, about 75% lower than
other models in Bedrock, and are integrated with key Bedrock features like fine-tuning, model distillation,
knowledge bases and RAG agentic capabilities.
Thousands of AWS customers are already taking advantage of the capabilities and price performance of Amazon
Nova models, including Palantir, Deloitte, SAP, Dentsu, Fortinet, Trellix, and Robinhood, and we've just gotten
started.
At the top layer of the stack, Amazon Q is the most capable Generative AI-powered assistant for software
development and to leverage your own data. You may remember that on the last call, I shared the very practical
use case where Q Transform helped save Amazon's teams $260 million and 4,500 developer years in migrating
over 30,000 applications to new versions of a Java JDK. This is real value and companies asked for more, which
we obliged with our recent deliveries of Q Transformations that enable moves from Windows.NET applications to
Linux, VMware to EC2, and accelerates mainframe migrations.
Early customer testing indicates that Q Transform was going to be a multiyear effort to do a mainframe migration
into a multi-quarter effort, cutting by more than 50% the time to migrate mainframes. This is a big deal and these
transformations are good examples of practical AI.
While AI continues to be a compelling new driver in the business, we haven't lost our focus on core modernization
of company's technology infrastructure from on-premises to the cloud. We signed new AWS agreements with
companies, including Intuit, PayPal, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, Northrop Grumman, The Guardian Life
Insurance Company of America, Reddit, Japan Airlines, Baker Hughes, The Hertz Corporation, Redfin, Chime
Financial, Asana, and many others.
Consistent customer feedback from our recent AWS re:Invent gathering was appreciation that we're still inventing
rapidly in non-AI key infrastructure areas like storage, compute, database and analytics.

Our functionality leadership continues to expand, and there were several key launches customers were abuzz
about, including Amazon Aurora DSQL, our new serverless distributed SQL database that enables applications
with the highest availability, strong consistency, PostgreS compatibility and four times faster reads and writes
compared to other popular distributed SQL databases, Amazon S3 tables, which make S3 the first cloud object
store with fully managed support for Apache Iceberg for faster analytics.
Amazon S3 Metadata, which automatically generates queryable metadata, simplifying data discovery, business
analytics and real-time inference to help customers unlock the value of their data in S3. And the next generation
of Amazon SageMaker, which brings together all of the data analytics services and AI services into one interface
to do analytics and AI more easily at scale.
As 2024 comes to an end, I want to thank our teammates and partners for their meaningful impact throughout the
year. It was a very successful year across almost any dimension you pick. We're far from done and look forward
to delivering for customers in 2025.
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.

Thanks, Andy. Starting with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $187.8 billion, an 11% increase
year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This equates to an approximate $900 million headwind
from FX in the quarter, which is about $700 million higher than what we had anticipated in our Q4 guidance range.
Excluding that additional FX headwind, we would have exceeded the top end of our revenue guidance range.
Worldwide operating income was $21.2 billion, our largest operating income quarter ever and was $1.2 billion
above the high end of our guidance range. Across all segments, we continued to innovate for customers while
operating more efficiently at the same time. In the North America segment, fourth quarter revenue was $115.6
billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year.
International segment revenue was $43.4 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign
exchange. Worldwide paid units grew 11% year-over-year as our focus on low prices, broad selection, and fast
shipping continues to resonate with customers.
Shifting to profitability. North America segment operating income was $9.3 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion year-
over-year. Operating margin was 8%, up 190 basis points year-over-year. In the International segment, operating
income was $1.3 billion, an improvement of $1.7 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 3%, up 400 basis
points year-over-year. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter where we've seen year-over-year margin
improvement in both the North America and International segments.
2024 also marks the second year in a row where we've lowered our global cost to serve on a per unit basis. In the
fourth quarter, we saw strong productivity in our transportation network from improved inventory placement,
higher units per package, and reduced travel distances. We also saw improved productivity in our fulfillment
centers.
Overall, our teams executed extremely well throughout the quarter and particularly during our peak seasons. I
want to thank them for all they do to deliver for our customers. Looking ahead, we have several opportunities to
keep lowering our costs through even better inventory placement, which also allows us to deliver items to
customers faster. In the US, we're tuning our inbound network and continuing to expand our same-day delivery

network. Globally, we're adding automation and robotics throughout our network. While these efforts will take time
to implement and progress may not be linear, we have a good plan to continue to drive improvements in our cost
structure.
Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North America and International segments. This
quarter, we saw strong advertising revenue growth on an increasingly large base. We will also continue to invest
in experiences that have potential to be important to customers and Amazon long term in areas like Alexa, health
care and grocery, as well as Kuiper, including the planned launches of our production satellites in the coming
months.
As a reminder, we currently expense the majority of the costs associated with the development of our satellite
network. We will capitalize certain costs once the service achieves commercial viability, including sales to
customers.
Moving next to our AWS segment. Revenue was $28.8 billion, an increase of 19% year-over-year. AWS now has
an annualized revenue run rate of $115 billion. During the fourth quarter, we continued to see growth in both
Generative AI and non-Generative AI offerings as companies turn their attention to newer initiatives, bring more
workloads to the cloud, restart or accelerate existing migrations from on-premise to the cloud, and tap into the
power of Generative AI.
Customers recognize to get the full benefit of Generative AI, they have to move to the cloud. AWS reported
operating income of $10.6 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion year-over-year. This is a result of strong growth,
innovation in our software and infrastructure to drive efficiencies, and continued focus on cost control across the
business. As we've said in the past, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the
level of investments we're making. Additionally, we increased the estimated useful life of our servers starting in
2024, which contributed approximately 200 basis points to the AWS margin increase year-over-year in Q4.
Now turning to our capital investments. As a reminder, as we define these as a combination of cash CapEx plus
equipment finance leases. Capital investments were $26.3 billion in the fourth quarter. And we think that run rate
will be reasonably representative of our 2025 capital investment rate. Similar to 2024, the majority of the spend
will be to support the growing need for technology infrastructure. This primarily relates to AWS, including to
support demand for our AI services as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and International
segments.
Additionally, we're continuing invest in capacity for our fulfillment and transportation network to support future
growth. We're also investing in same-day delivery facilities and our inbound network as well as robotics and
automation to improve delivery speeds and to lower our cost to serve. These capital investments will support
growth for many years to come.
Turning to our revenue guidance for Q1. Net sales are expected to be between $151 billion and $155.5 billion. I'd
like to highlight two items impacting our Q1 revenue guidance. First, we estimate the year-over-year impact of
changes in foreign exchange rates based on current rates, which we expect to be a headwind of approximately
$2.1 billion in Q1 year-over-year or 150 basis points. As a reminder, global currencies can fluctuate during the
quarter, and just as we saw in Q4 with the strengthening of the dollar versus most other currencies.
Second, a reminder that we are comping the impact of last year's leap year. The extra day contributed
approximately $1.5 billion of additional net sales across our businesses in Q1 2024 or about 120 basis points to
the year-over-year growth rate, which impacted all segments.

Q1 operating income is expected to be between $14 billion and $18 billion. This guidance includes the estimated
impact of certain updates to the useful life of our fixed assets. I'll provide a bit more detail in a moment, but on an
aggregate basis, we estimate this will decrease full year 2025 operating income by approximately $400 million for
the assets on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.
First, in Q4, we completed a useful life study for our servers and network equipment and observed an increased
pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning. As a result,
we're decreasing the useful life for a subset of our servers and networking equipment from 6 years to 5 years,
beginning in January 2025. We anticipate this will decrease full year 2025 operating income by approximately
$700 million.
In addition, we also early retired a subset of our servers and network equipment. We recorded a Q4 2024
expense of approximately $920 million from accelerated depreciation and related charges and expect this will also
decrease full year 2025 operating income by approximately $600 million. Both of these server and network
equipment useful life changes primarily impact our AWS segment.
Lastly, we also completed a useful life study for certain types of heavy equipment used in our fulfillment centers
and are increasing the useful life from 10 years to 13 years beginning in January 2025. We anticipate this will
increase full year 2025 operating income by approximately $900 million.
As we turn the page to 2025, we're energized by the great work our teams have delivered. We'll remain focused
on driving even better customer experience, and we believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to
create lasting value for our shareholders.
With that, let's move on to your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: At this time, we will now open the call up for question. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first
question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Mahaney Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Thanks. Two quick questions. So Brian, that's $100 billion CapEx we should think about in 2025. And then Andy,
were there any – so would you describe that AWS growth as being currently moderated down by supply
constraints? Do you see those across the industry or do you see those materially impacting AWS today? Thank
you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
So, I'll take both of those, this is Andy. On the CapEx side, as Brian mentioned earlier, we spent $26.3 billion in
CapEx in Q4. And I think that is reasonably representative of what you could expect in annualized CapEx rate in
2025. The vast majority of that CapEx spend is on AI for AWS. It's – the way the AWS business works and the
way the cash cycle works is that the faster we grow, the more CapEx we end up spending because we have to
procure datacenter and hardware and chips and networking gear ahead of when we're able to monetize it.
We don't procure it unless we see significant signals of demand. And so when AWS is expanding its CapEx,
particularly in what we think is one of these once-in-a-lifetime type of business opportunities like AI represents, I
think it's actually quite a good sign, medium to long term, for the AWS business. And I actually think that spending
this capital to pursue this opportunity, which from our perspective, we think virtually every application that we
know of today is going to be reinvented with AI inside of it and with inference being a core building block, just like
compute and storage and database.
If you believe that plus altogether new experiences that we've only dreamed about are going to actually be
available to us with AI, AI represents, for sure, the biggest opportunity since cloud and probably the biggest
technology shift and opportunity in business since the Internet. And so I think that both our business, our
customers and shareholders will be happy medium-to-long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and
the business opportunity in AI.
We also have CapEx that we're spending this year in our Stores business, really with an aim towards trying to
continue to improve the delivery speed and our cost to serve. And so, you'll see us expanding the number of
same-day facilities from where we are right now. You'll also see us expand the number of delivery stations that we
have in rural areas. We can get items to people who live in rural areas much more quickly, and then a pretty
significant investment as well on robotics and automation so we can take our cost to serve down and continue to
improve our productivity.
So that's the CapEx piece. I think the second question you asked, Mark, is really around AWS growth and
whether this is being moderated down at all by supply chain constraints. It is hard to complain when you have a
multibillion-dollar annualized revenue run rate business in AI, like we do, and it's growing triple-digit percentage
year-over-year. It's hard to complain. However, it is true that we could be growing faster, if not for some of the
constraints on capacity.

And they come in the form of, I would say, chips from our third-party partners, coming a little bit slower than
before with a lot of midstream changes that take a little bit of time to get the hardware actually yielding the
percentage healthy and high-quality servers we expect. It comes with our own big new launch of our own
hardware and our own chips in Trainium2, which we just went to general availability at re:Invent, but the majority
of the volume is coming in really over the next couple quarters, next few months.
It comes in the form of power constraints where I think the world is still constrained on power from where I think
we all believe we could serve customers if we were unconstrained. There are some components in the supply
chain, like motherboards too, that are a little bit short in supply for various types of servers. So, I think the team
has done a really good job scrapping and providing capacity for our customers, so they can grow. We're still
growing at a pretty reasonable clip, as I mentioned earlier, but do think we could be growing faster if were
unconstrained. I predict those constraints really start to relax in the second half of 2025. And as I said, I think, we
could be growing faster even though we're growing at a pretty good clip today.

Operator: And our next question is from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric J. Sheridan Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Thanks so much for taking the question. I'll just ask one that's building on Mark's questions there. Andy, when you
think about the news that came out of China over the last couple of weeks and think longer term about bending
the cost curve lower with AI, I understood the commentary around CapEx for 2025. But when you look at where
you sit in the industry, the move towards open source, elements of custom silicon, how do you think about
bending the cost curve and either speeding up or amplifying time deployment to market or possibly higher returns
on capital for AI? Thanks so much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah. Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think, like many
others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done. I think in part impressed with some of the training
techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training – reinforcement learning being earlier
and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning.
We also thought some of the inference optimizations they did were also quite interesting. For those of us who are
building frontier models, we're all working on the same types of things and we're all learning from one another. I
think you have seen and will continue to see a lot of leapfrogging between us. There is a lot of innovation to
come. And I think, if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big
Generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different
models for different types of workloads.
You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. And that's
what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that
DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others. And we already
have customers starting to experiment with that.
I think what's – one of the interesting things over the last couple weeks is sometimes people make the
assumptions that if you're able to decrease the cost of any type of technology component, in this case, we're
really talking about inference, that somehow it's going to lead to less total spend in technology. And we just – we

have never seen that to be the case. We did the same thing in the cloud where we launched AWS in 2006, where
we offered S3 object storage for $0.15 a gigabyte and compute for $0.10 an hour, which, of course, is much lower
now many years later.
People thought that people would spend a lot less money on infrastructure technology. And what happens is
companies will spend a lot less per unit of infrastructure, and that is very, very useful for their businesses. But
then they get excited about what else they could build that they always thought was cost prohibitive before, and
they usually end up spending a lot more in total on technology once you make the per unit cost less.
And I think that is very much what's going to happen here in AI, which is the cost of inference will substantially
come down. What you heard in the last couple of weeks out of DeepSeek is a piece of it. But everybody is
working on this. I believe the cost of inference will meaningfully come down. I think it will make it much easier for
companies to be able to infuse all their applications with inference and with Generative AI.
And I think, it's going to – if you run a business like we do, where we want to make it as easy as possible for
customers to be successful building customer experiences on top of our various infrastructure services, the cost
of inference coming down is going to be very positive for customers and for our business.

Operator: And the next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Doug Anmuth Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. I'll stick with AWS to start. Just Brian, maybe you can talk a little bit more about
margins there, just given that they've kind of moved between the mid-20s to high-30s over the past two years.
How should we think about that more normalized especially as you're investing that much more in Generative AI?
And then just on the Stores side, can you talk about the impact of less volume going through your shipping
partner, UPS, going forward? And are you able to manage that incremental shipping that's required? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Olsavsky A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah. Sure, Doug. Thanks for your question. First on AWS, yeah, we have seen a lot of fluctuation in operating
margin in AWS. And we've said historically that they will be lumpy, as you say, over time. And at the stage we're
in right now, AI is still early stage. It does come originally with lower margins and a heavy investment load as
we've talked about.
And in the short term, over time, that should have – be a headwind on margins. But over the long term, we feel
the margins will be comparable in non-AI business as well. So, we're very pleased with the strong growth, focused
on driving efficiencies in all of our data centers, saving power. We're using power in new Generative AI
applications and just generally reducing costs. So very pleased with the performance of the AWS team, and I look
forward to a strong 2025.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
I'll take the UPS one, which is really, UPS has been a partner of ours for many years, and we expect that we'll
continue to be partners with UPS for many years. As you know, increasingly, over the last several years,
particularly accelerated by the pandemic, we have shipped a much larger percentage of our shipments through
our own logistics network, our own last mile transportation network.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 06-Feb-2025
And yeah, I think that's in part because we needed to scale up so fast in the pandemic with everything being shut
down and needing to serve more of the total market segment share of retail units during that time, and needing to
do it at a low-cost structure because, of course, our customers expect low prices and that's the nature of the
business. I think UPS has decided that serving Amazon is a lower margin for them. And so, I think they've walked
away from some of the volume that they otherwise could have had in the partnership. We're able to handle it with
our own logistics capability, and we'll see how it continues to evolve.

Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Nowak Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my question. Andy, maybe to drill a little bit into the robotics acceleration that you talked about,
any new data points maybe you can share on learnings from Shreveport. And how do we think about sort of the
scalability of savings or the timing that we could see a real impact on profitability from robotics?
And then maybe just a bigger picture, GenAI, GPU-enabled changes. Do you have other examples of how you
see the Amazon retail shopping experience changing throughout 2025 as you're better using GenAI or GPU
enabled machine learning and things?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. Well, on the robotics piece, what I would tell you is since we've been pretty substantially integrating
robotics into our fulfillment network over the last many years, we have seen cost savings and we've seen
productivity improvements and we've seen safety improvements. And so, we have already gotten a significant
amount of value out of our robotics innovations.
What we've seen recently, and I think maybe part what you're referencing in Shreveport, is that the next tranche
of robotics initiatives have started hitting production. And we've put them all together for the first time as part of an
experience in our Shreveport facility. And we are very, very encouraged by what we're seeing there, by both the
speed improvements that we're seeing, the productivity improvements, the cost to serve improvements. It's still
relatively early days, and these all being put together only in Shreveport at this point, but we have plans now to
start to expand that and roll that out to a number of other facilities in the network, some of which will be our new
facilities and others of which we'll retrofit existing facilities to be able to use those same robotics innovations.
I'll also tell you that this group of, call it, a half a dozen or so new initiatives is not close to the end of what we think
is possible with respect to being able to use robotics to improve the productivity cost to serve and safety in our
fulfillment network. And we have kind of the next wave that we're starting to work on now. But I think this will be a
many-year effort as we continue to tune different parts of our fulfillment network where we can use robotics. And
we actually don't think there are that many things that we can't improve the experience with robotics.
On your other question, which is, I think, really about how we might use AI in other areas of the business, in AWS,
maybe more, I think you asked about our retail business. The way I would think about it is that there's kind of two
macro buckets of how we see people, both ourselves inside Amazon as well as other companies using AWS, how
we see them getting value out of AI today.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 06-Feb-2025
The first macro bucket, I would say, is really around productivity and cost savings. And in many ways, this is the
lowest-hanging fruit in AI, and you see that all over the place in our retail business. For instance, if you look at
customer service and you look at the chatbot that we've built, we completely rearchitected it with Generative AI.
It's delivering. It already had pretty high satisfaction. It's delivering 500 basis points better satisfaction from
customers with the new Generative AI-infused chatbot.
If you look at our millions of third-party selling partners, one of their biggest pain points is because we put a high
premium on really organizing our marketplace so it's easy to find things, there's a bunch of different fields you
have to fill out when you're creating a new product detail page, but we've built a Generative AI application for
them where they can either fill in just a couple of lines of text or take a picture of an image or point to a URL, and
the Generative AI app will fill in most of the rest of the information they have to fill out, which speeds are getting
selection on the website and easier for sellers.
If you look at how we do inventory management and trying to understand what inventory we need and what
facility at what time, the Generative AI applications we've built there have led to 10% better forecasting on our part
and 20% better regional predictions.
In our robotics, we were just talking about, the brains in a lot of those robotics are Generative AI infused that do
things like tell the robotic claw, what's in a bin, what it should pick up, how it should move in, where it should place
it in the other bin that it's filling like. So, it's really in the brains of most of our robotics.
So, we have a number of very significant, I'll call it, productivity and cost savings efforts in our retail business.
They're using Generative AI. And again, it's just a fraction of what we have going. I'd say, the other big macro
bucket are really altogether new experiences. And again, you see lots of those in our retail business, ranging from
Rufus, which is our AI-infused shopping assistant, which continues to grow very significantly, to things like
Amazon Lens, where you could take a picture of a product that's in front of you, check it out in the app, you can
find it the little box at the top.
You take a picture of an item in front of you, and it uses computer vision and Generative AI to pull up the exact
item in search result; to things like sizing, where we basically have taken the catalogs of all these different
clothing manufacturers and then compare them against one another so we know which brands tend to run big or
small relative to each other. So, when you come to buy a pair of shoes, for instance, it can recommend what size
you need.
To even what we're doing in Thursday Night Football, where we're using Generative AI for really inventive
features like defensive alerts where we predict which players are going to blitz the quarterback, or defensive
vulnerabilities where we were able to show viewers what area of the field is vulnerable. So, we're using it really all
over our retail business and all the businesses in which we're in. We've got about 1,000 different Generative AI
applications we've either built or are in the process of building right now.

John Blackledge Q
Analyst, TD Cowen
Hi. Great. Thanks. Could you talk about the current speed of delivery? Maybe how much more room to go there
and how is it driving the everyday essentials business? And then somewhat relatedly, any further color on
inbound network efficiencies you would expect to see this year as you guys try to continue to lower the cost to
serve? Thank you.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 06-Feb-2025
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah. I would say on speed of delivery that we measure this very carefully. And we measure both, what the
conversion rate is of somebody who views a product detail page with a faster delivery promise versus those that
are slower, as well as what we see downstream from customers once they bought with a fast promise and what
they end up buying throughout the year.
And we have not yet seen diminishing returns and being able to continue to improve the speed of delivery. It
doesn't mean that there won't be instances in which people are happy to take products later. We have a program
where people want to pick a day during the week where they want to combine a bunch of their shipments and
have it delivered then to be more sustainable and more environmentally friendly they can.
And we have plenty of customers who choose that, but we time in and time out, see that people choose to buy
from us more frequently, and we're able to deliver to their homes or wherever they are much more quickly. And it
leads to actually using us for more of their everyday purchases when we can deliver more quickly.
And I think that if you look at what we're doing with Prime Air, the promise there is for a number of items that we'll
be able to deliver items to customers inside an hour. And I think, when you're ordering everyday essentials where
you need something more quickly, it's a big deal. And you see it, it's had impact on our everyday essentials. It's
had a big impact on our pharmacy business, where people are able to get items same day now in lots of cities
throughout the US. And they're just using us much more frequently than they had before.
On the inbound network efficiencies, what I would tell you is we've made a pretty significant architectural change
in our inbound network, that we've been working on for the better part of the year that we rolled out just a few
months ago. Again, it's – what we find when we make big architectural changes like this is that you tend to get
some low-hanging fruit efficiencies early, but then there's all sorts of tuning and refinement you have to do once
you actually see it working live across the really vast network.
And we have all sorts of ways here that, where I think it's early, and I think we're going to get additional
efficiencies throughout the year. But I expect that we'll have opportunities to keep taking our cost to serve down
this year and that will be a big part of it.

Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Michael Morton with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed.

Michael Morton Q
Analyst, MoffettNathanson LLC
Hi. Thank you so much for the question. I wanted to follow-up on Andy's remarks about how you're using AI within
the Amazon e-commerce experience. But I wanted to talk about the other side of the coin, and that's really the e-
commerce discovery process that leads people to Amazon. There's a lot of companies rolling out agents and
assistants, and I would love to hear how Amazon is planning for potential disruption in this funnel and what the
plans are. You spoke about Rufus, maybe make that more prominent. But what do you think the changes coming
to the e-commerce funnel over the next several years would be great?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
Well, I would say that I think retailers, ourselves and probably lots of other retailers are all going to have their own
say on how they want to interact with agents. I think, it's an emerging space. And if you think about the

investments that we've made in our fulfillment network, in our website, in all the selection that we've built, how we
organize it, most retailers are going to have kind of terms in which they're going to interact with agents, and we'll
be no different that way.
And I think that – I do think that Rufus, if you look at what it – how it impacts the customer experience and if you
actually use it month-to-month, it continues to get better and better. It's already – if you're buying something and
you're on a product detail page, our product detail pages provide so much information that sometimes it's hard if
you're trying to find something quickly to scroll through and figure – and find that little piece of information. And so,
we have so many customers now who just use Rufus to help them find a quick fact about a product.
They also use Rufus to figure out how to summarize customer reviews, so they don't have to read 100 customer
reviews to get a sense of what people think about that product. If you look at the personalization, really, most
prominently today, your ability to go into Rufus and ask what's happened to an order or what did I just order, or
can you pull up for me this item that I ordered two months ago? The personalization keeps getting much better.
And so, we expect throughout 2025, that the number of occasions where you're not sure what you want to buy
and you want help from Rufus are going to continue to increase and be more and more helpful to customers.

Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Thanks, Katherine, and hi, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. As every company transforms to embrace
the AI era, Snowflake remains at the center of today's AI revolution. We have delivered yet another strong
quarter, thanks to the hard work and dedication across our team to help our customers realize value through all
their end-to-end data life cycle, and effectively harness AI's potential every step of the way.
Our continued focus on operational rigor and close-knit products and go-to-market execution has helped us
maintain strength across our core business and innovate rapidly to bring new capabilities to market. We are
executing with urgency and focus and maintaining deep partnerships with our customers that enable us to capture
the opportunity in front of us and sustain durable momentum.
Product revenue in Q3 was $1.16 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations totaled
$7.88 billion, with year-over-year growth accelerating to 37%. Our net revenue retention remained stable at a very
healthy 125%, and we added a record 615 new customers this quarter. As we continue to deliver strong revenue

growth and healthy results, we are increasing our growth expectations for the year and reiterating our margin
target.
As I've shared, Snowflake is on a mission to empower every enterprise to achieve its full potential through data
and AI, and we are making incredible progress against that mission every day. We continue to double down on
what makes Snowflake unique, delivering an AI Data Cloud that's truly enterprise-ready with a radical focus on
our customers. Snowflake is intuitive and easy to use, seamlessly connected for collaboration and built with the
security and governance that enterprises trust as their foundation. That's why customers like Coca-Cola
Consolidated, PayPal and thousands more are transforming their businesses with Snowflake. And it's why more
organizations than ever are going all in on Snowflake as their foundational data and AI platform.
Already, Snowflake is the cornerstone for our customers' AI strategy. In Q3, more than 7,300 accounts are using
our AI capabilities every week. Just recently, Morgan Stanley named Snowflake its Strategic Partner of the Year,
recognizing how our AI Data Cloud is accelerating their transformation and driving AI innovation across one of the
world's leading financial institutions. And with the general availability of Snowflake Intelligence, we are seeing the
fastest ramp in product adoption in our company history. Already 1,200 customers are harnessing next-generation
agentic AI capabilities to drive real business impact at scale.
Snowflake Intelligence is transforming how businesses interact with their data, turning natural language into real-
time actionable intelligence. For example, TS Imagine, a global SaaS platform for financial services, use
Snowflake Intelligence to build an AI agent that now handles staff equal to 8.5 full-time employees. The agent
helps users manage and query data, make faster trading and risk management decisions and automate customer
case resolution, increasing transparency across teams and with clients. And Fanatics, the global leader in sports
merchandise and e-commerce, uses Snowflake Intelligence to connect billions of fan data points across
shopping, collectibles and gaming platform for more than 100 million fans worldwide. This unified data foundation
helps Fanatics better understand its customers, boost sales, and grow its advertising business, powering the
launch of new Fanatics advertising audience network this year.
This momentum has enabled us to achieve a major milestone. $100 million in AI revenue run rate, achieved one
quarter earlier than anticipated, thanks to our pace of innovation, cross-functional collaboration and early adoption
among many of our marquee customers. Because we operate as a consumption-based business, this number
reflects real-world enterprise usage. It's a direct signal of how customers are using our AI capabilities in
production to create value today.
What's more, our AI capabilities are strengthening our customer relationships and expanding the value we deliver
across every stage of the data lifecycle. AI is a key driver of the strength that we see in our core business.
In Q3, we landed a record number of new logos, and continue to build strong momentum with AI influencing 50%
of the bookings signed this quarter. We also deepened relationships with existing customers as 28% of all use
cases deployed during the quarter incorporated AI.
Being enterprise-ready is not just about innovation, it's also about reliability. When a major cloud service provider
experienced an outage this quarter, our disaster recovery capability seamlessly transferred more than 300
mission-critical workloads to backup systems, ensuring business continuity for our customers when it mattered
the most.
Our commitment to making business critical capabilities, just work continues to resonate with our customers. And
so, we've built on this strength by expanding not only our product capabilities, but our ecosystem. This quarter

alone, we announced new partnerships with Workday, Splunk, Palantir, UiPath and more to deepen integration,
enable secure and seamless data access across the systems our customers use every day and unlock new
innovations like agent-to-agent collaboration.
More recently, we announced a landmark partnership with SAP to unite mission-critical business data with the
Snowflake AI Data Cloud. We're already supporting customers like AstraZeneca to access and analyze real-time
data. These partnerships amplify our ability to deliver value to joint customers and extend our go-to-market reach.
Our progress is clearly resonating with our global community. During Snowflake's annual World Tour, over 40,000
customers, partners and prospects joined us across 23 events, a record-breaking turnoff representing a more
than 40% year-on-year increase in participation from last year.
More recently, our annual build Developer Summit saw a 43% increase in attendance year-over-year,
underscoring the growing excitement and engagement across our global audience. Behind this incredible
momentum is our relentless focus, and continued delivery against our product strategy.
Throughout the quarter, Snowflake maintained a rapid pace of innovation, bringing our total GA product
capabilities to 370 year-to-date, a 35% increase over last year with AI being front and center. As I shared,
Snowflake Intelligence continues to set the tone for enterprise-grade agentic AI.
Just recently, we announced that Snowflake is the official data cloud provider for USA Bobsled/Skeleton,
powering their journey to the upcoming Olympic Games. The team is using Snowflake Intelligence to unify and
analyze data across its performance ecosystem to optimize, push performance and equip coaches with data-
driven insights to create a competitive edge on the ice for a medal-worthy performance.
At the core of our AI philosophy is customer choice and flexibility, empowering organizations to leverage the
world's leading models securely on their own enterprise data. As you may have seen a few weeks ago, we
announced a partnership with Google Cloud to make the latest Gemini models available to our 12,600-plus
customers within Cortex AI and Snowflake Intelligence, further enhancing access and customer choice.
To drive even more tailored innovation, we introduced Cortex AI for financial services, a comprehensive suite of
AI capabilities and partnerships that empower financial services companies to unify their financial data
ecosystem, deploy AI models, applications and agents securely and meet the rigorous security and compliance
standards for regulated industry.
Even as we supercharge the data lifecycle with AI, we remain committed to strengthening our core data
foundation, to ensure that Snowflake will continue to deliver the trusted, performant, and scalable data platform
our customers rely on every day. Key capabilities like Snowflake Openflow are making it easier than ever to bring
in structured, unstructured, batch or streaming data into Snowflake.
Take EVgo, which is using open Openflow to simplify and speed up how it ingests data across its EV charging
network. By consolidating multiple data pipelines into Snowflake, EVgo has reduced latency, improved reliability
and gained a more complete view of its customers and charging stations.
And we are continuing to extend our value through strategic acquisitions. We recently acquired the technology
behind Datometry's software migration solution, which will enable our customers to move from legacy data
warehouses to Snowflake, at lower cost and with minimal disruption, further simplifying their journey to our AI
Data Cloud.

We've also agreed to acquire Select Star to enhance our Horizon Catalog and deliver a more complete view of an
enterprise's data estate. We believe this richer context will empower agentic AI experiences like Snowflake
Intelligence to better understand enterprise data and uncover deeper insight.
As we scale the breadth and depth of our product capabilities, we continue to maintain tight integration across
sales, marketing, product and engineering to effectively launch and scale new offerings and deepen our customer
relationships.
This alignment is driving tangible results. Q3 marked a strong bookings quarter, underscored by accelerating
RPO growth and healthy customer retention. At the same time, we're investing in and strengthening our strategic
go-to-market partnerships.
In addition to those I've already mentioned, today, we've announced an expanded partnership with Anthropic.
This brings native model availability into Snowflake, and also introduces a new joint go-to-market motion designed
to accelerate enterprise AI adoption.
We also continue to build our strong relationships with major cloud providers. In fact, Snowflake has already
surpassed $2 billion in sales through AWS Marketplace in a single calendar year, and was just recognized with 14
AWS Partner award wins, more than any other ISV provider. This underscores the extraordinary demand for
Snowflake's AI Data Cloud.
Momentum is also accelerating with our global systems integrators. Accenture just launched a Snowflake
Business Group, committing to train over 5,000 professionals on Snowflake Solutions to help joint customers
realize AI value faster.
Already, Accenture and Snowflake are helping customers like Caterpillar unlock the full value of their operational
data. This collaboration is improving quality in manufacturing, providing timely insights for finance, and helping
teams share knowledge and solve complex challenges faster.
As you can see, it's a milestone quarter for Snowflake, defined by exceptional advances in product innovation and
incredible customer momentum. As we deepen our strategic partnerships with the world's leading cloud service
providers, AI model developers, SaaS providers and global system integrators, we're unlocking new levels of
performance, accessibility and AI-driven insight for our customers, while expanding the value and impact of the
Snowflake platform across industry.
I'm incredibly proud of our team for their efficiency and discipline they continue to demonstrate across the
business. Our operational rhythm remains strong. And as we invest strategically for long-term growth, we are
building the foundation for sustained scale and high durable growth.
To help lead us through this next phase, I'm pleased to introduce Brian Robins as our new Chief Financial Officer.
Brian brings extensive experience as a CFO across high-growth software companies and a deep understanding
of scaling financial operations with discipline.
Brian, why don't you take us through some of the financial details?

Q3 2026 Earnings Call 03-Dec-2025
Thank you, Sridhar. It's a truly exciting time for me to be at Snowflake.
In Q3, we delivered strong results across revenue, bookings and margins. Our product revenue grew 29% year-
over-year, fueled by durable growth in our core business and continued expansion into data engineering and AI
workloads. Together, these factors contributed to a stable net retention rate of 125%. Financial services and
technology verticals led growth in Q3.
We continue to see significant opportunity to expand within our existing customer base. Our Global 2000
customers now total 776, with each of these accounts spending, on average, $2.3 million on a trailing 12-month
basis.
Many of these customers are still in the early stages of their Snowflake journey with ample room for further
growth. Q3 was an excellent quarter for go-to-market execution. We achieved strong booking results, signing four
nine-figure deals. This represents a record number of large deals signed in a single quarter.
Our focus on new customer acquisition continues to show yield. As Sridhar mentioned, it was a record quarter for
new customer wins, adding over 600 new customers. Our ability to expand with existing customers and bring new
ones onto the platform, underscores the strength of our business model. Equally important, we continue to
operate with financial discipline, delivering healthy margins as we scale.
Q3 non-GAAP product gross margins was 75.9%. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded more than 450 basis
points year-over-year to 11%, reflecting our continued focus on driving greater efficiency across the entire
company.
As a reminder, we intentionally front-loaded our sales and marketing hiring in the year. Non-GAAP adjusted free
cash flow margin was 11%. In Q3, we used $233 million to repurchase 1 million shares at a weighted average
price per share of $223.35. We still have $1.3 billion remaining on our original authorization for $4.5 billion
through March of 2027. We ended the quarter with $4.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-
term investments.
Moving now to our outlook. For Q4, we expect product revenue between $1.195 billion and $1.2 billion,
representing a 27% year-over-year growth. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of 7%. We are raising our FY
2026 product revenue guidance. We now expect product revenue of approximately $4.446 billion, representing
28% year-over-year growth.
We are reiterating our FY 2026 margin targets. We expect non-GAAP product gross margin of 75%, non-GAAP
operating margin of 9%, and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin of 25%.
Before moving to Q&A, I'd like to share my perspective on my first 60 days here at Snowflake. Three key
takeaways have truly stood out. First and foremost, I've been incredibly impressed by the caliber and energy of
the Snowflake team. There's a sense of winning energy in every meeting and profound pride in their daily work.
Specifically, the depth of the bench within our finance organization is exceptionally strong and ready to support
our next phase of growth.
Second, I prioritized spending my initial weeks meeting with customers. The customers I spoke with were
fanatical about Snowflake and the transformational impact our platform has had on their business. They're placing
the AI Data Cloud at the absolute center of their strategic initiatives, underscoring our essential role in their future.

Finally, the velocity of our product releases and innovation engine is world-class and consistently sets us apart.
Snowflake sits at the intersection of a massive market opportunity, and I could not be more excited to be part of
scaling this phenomenal team [ph] and seizing (00:20:06) amazing growth ahead.
As we look forward, my focus is on continuing to deliver efficient growth. I believe that continued alignment across
our finance, go-to-market and product teams will enable us to balance growth with disciplined execution.
With that, I'll now pass the call to operator for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjit Singh with the company Morgan Stanley.
Sanjit, your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjit K. Singh Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. Thank you for taking the questions. I had one for Brian and one for Sridhar. Brian, first for you, when we
look at the growth rates on product revenue this quarter, really attractive at 29%, it was just about 3% beat,
slightly below 3% beat versus the midpoint of guidance. But at the same time, when I look at your Q4 guide, it's
probably the best sequential guide I've seen from the company in a couple of years. So, I was wondering if you
could help us square that.
And then for Sridhar, like really impressive in terms of getting to that $100 million AI revenue run rate. You
mentioned on the press release that Snowflake Intelligence is one of the fastest adopting products. So, wondering
if you can give us a color on the types of customers that are taking on your AI products, some of the use cases
that Snowflake Intelligence is unlocking. And also if you could comment on kind of Cortex AI adoption. Thanks for
the time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian G. Robins A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Thanks, Sanjit. I'll answer the first part of the question on the financials. We're happy with the performance this
quarter. We delivered 29% year-over-year revenue growth. The quarter pretty much played out as expected.
There was really only one surprise in the quarter, and that was a hyperscaler outage, which impacted our revenue
approximately $1 million to $2 million within the quarter.
I think it's really important with the consumption model that not to view quarterly beats as the best signal of the
fundamentals within the business. The quarter, as you mentioned, we raised our fiscal year guidance by $51
million or $4.446 billion. And the FY guide is really the most meaningful signal. And I think the guide really reflects
the underlying behavior that we see in our customer base going into the fourth quarter.
Sridhar, over to you.

Sridhar Ramaswamy A

my sales team, whether it is consumption information or the Workday hierarchy itself of who is managing whom,
information about customers, their use cases. And it's been a magical unlock for several thousand people
because things that they needed to painfully find dashboards for, they can have answered immediately.
Plus, you also get the benefit that unlike a dashboard, which is a 2D representation of a pretty complex space,
you can ask questions that cut across any dimension, analyze data in ways that previously were simply not
possible before. And so, we have a slew of customers, whether it is the USA Bobsled team or Fanatics, or folks
like ServiceNow or TS Imagine that are using this to create data agents specialized for some areas, so anyone
that is working in a particular function for example, has all of the data that is relevant to them available from a
single interface and right on their phone or laptop computer. It is that unlock of access to this data that is driving
adoption.
What I can tell you is like I – whenever I have dinners with CIOs or with CEOs, and we are talking about them
often, they turn out to be Snowflake customers, and I end up showing off Snowflake Intelligence on my phone,
usually to show them information that I – we have about their companies, like how much they're spending, what
use cases they have deployed.
And the first thing that comes from them is they want this for their own business. That's the attraction of
Snowflake Intelligence, which is it puts all of the data that matters to you right at your fingertips. And unlike before,
this data is not confined to analysts. This is to every single business user within a company, and that's the big
unlock file.

Operator: The next question comes from Kirk Materne with the company Evercore ISI. Kirk, your line is now
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kirk Materne Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Yeah. Thanks very much, and thanks for taking the question, guys. Sridhar, I was wondering if you could just talk
about the go-to-market. You guys mentioned you had a really nice quarter. And I was particularly interested in the
600 new customer wins. And I realize you all land small and then grow with your customers.
But with AI coming on in Snowflake Intelligence, are you landing with more products now, meaning is it still
landing with the core data warehouse and then expanding? Or you were able to land with multiple products at
once and then grow from there. I'm just kind of curious about whether your surface area is growing within some of
these new customers. Thanks very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Hey, Kirk, thanks for the question. Well, I think things like Snowflake Intelligence now play a key role in making
the power of data come alive every single time we're pitching a new logo. One of the magic of recent advances in
AI is our ability to do demos or POCs, proof of concepts, that are hyper-customized for each customers.

Often we will generate a synthetic data set that they will mimic an oil producer or a pharmaceutical company and
show them the art of the possible. Previously when people got onto Snowflake, it was for an abstract need. It was
to make data more efficiently accessible so that you could do more analytics.
Now, we do the work to show them what is possible with a product like Snowflake Intelligence on top of their data,
it just makes the value of the transition from previous systems onto Snowflake even more clear. And those are
some of the stats that we've been sharing with you, which is AI having a helping hand, it's not the dominant thing
but definitely having a helping hand in more than – in close to 50% of the new logos that we acquire, I would say
definitely opens up our aperture.
On the other hand, I would add that products that are lower down the stack, products like Openflow are taking off
because they actually help make the other side of the data lifecycle more efficient. I've used Openflow. It's pretty
magical to be able to sync data, whether it's from an Oracle OLTP system or from Google Drive onto Snowflake. I
think shrewd investments like that are also helping us substantially in just accelerating what people do with us.
Previously, we used to be just the analytics provider, but we can be there from soup to nuts with products starting
with Openflow, but then things like Snowpark, obviously, our analytics engine, then ML and then AI. It's where this
breadth of offering and the complete data offering will end up playing a larger and larger role.

Operator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill with the company Jefferies. Brent, your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brent Thill Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. And Sridhar, good to hear the news on AI bookings influenced. I guess many are now turning to the go-
lives. And when do you expect this batch of go-lives to go up that then helps re-influence the – even more
excitement on the platform? How do you think about the trajectory and does that – does it have a bigger
ramification in the back half to 2026 then as those deals go live?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Well, you're seeing it live, right. We gave guidance for Q4. It's a pretty hefty beat and raise. And that is driven by
what we see in consumption trends. As you know, we tend to be pretty disciplined about how we forecast and
guide. These are based on machine learning models. Unsurprisingly, that predicts the future, and we are
disciplined in following that.
On the other hand, we track the other side, which is how many use cases are we winning, what is the time
duration from a win over to a technical implementation, over to a go-live. And accelerating go-lives will continue to
be a priority. And we're using AI pretty heavily in making some of these use cases go live a whole lot faster as
well. And all of these feeds into the forecast and guides and the general optimism that we convey to you.

Operator: Next question...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
...our confidence in being – in having AI drive more and more of our revenue, it is a commitment. But as you see
the front side of things like the AI consumption revenue ARR that we announced, the $100 million ARR, that's
what gives us confidence that partnerships with Anthropic, which include a buy, but also a broader go-to-market
motion will continue to accelerate the overall business.

Operator: The next question comes from Brad Zelnick with the company Deutsche Bank. Brad, your line is now
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Hey, guys. This is Dan on for Brad. Just wanted to ask maybe Sridhar to start, just if you can kind of help frame
the impact that migrations had product revenue this quarter versus last quarter. I know there were some kind of
unique circumstance last quarter where some positive things came together to drive a pretty strong result. But just
in general, I think across all of the cloud names, we've seen pretty strong momentum this year. And just as you
look at kind of the visibility and pacing here that you have into that, maybe just the sustainability of what you're
seeing on that side.
And then maybe one for Brian, just on operating margins. I think 4Q operating margin was guided maybe a couple
of points below where you guided 3Q and maybe a little down from what was implied in the guide last quarter.
Anything just to unpack on op margins into Q4 for us to think about as we build our models? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
I'll start. We are super-early with migrations. I think you folks heard Matt Garman say today that he thinks maybe
like we are 15% to 20% of the way through kind of on-prem legacy migrations. And that's positive news for
Snowflake.
And I see AI, I see products like Snowflake Intelligence, exert both a powerful tool because the data that's in
Snowflake just became more valuable because it can be used to drive business a whole lot more effectively, but I
also see AI play a big role in pushing migrations forward. In other words, making the act of migrating from legacy
systems go faster. And this is where tuck-in acquisitions like the acquisition of Datometry, which makes products
that make migrations go faster, easier are also helpful.
We keep a close watch on migrations through the entirety of the use case lifecycle, and it's something that we are
continuously looking to accelerate, bring better techniques. It's an area that I've been personally involved with
throughout the year, and we continue to make very solid progress.

Brian G. Robins A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. Just real quickly on the 4Q guidance, all I would say is that 4Q is a little tricky in a sense that you're giving
the 4Q guidance and the annual guidance at the same time. And so don't read too much into that. There's nothing
intended by – meant to read into that.

open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raimo Lenschow Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thank you. One question, to stick to the one question rule, Sridhar, Zero Copy comes up a lot in the conversation.
And like every vendor is now talking about like, oh, we're doing Zero Copy that helps to kind of – help us play
better with everyone else in the ecosystem, et cetera. How do you think that will impact you? Is it kind of – does it
drive more adoption? Does it impact how much you can monetize? Can you speak to that, please? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. Zero Copy generally comes up in the context of SaaS vendors, who are under a lot of pressure from their
customers to share data. Many of them are busy creating data products on top of the data as a way to monetize.
And Zero Copy or sometimes bidirectional data sharing agreements come up in that context as a faster, more
efficient way for people to share data with each other. We see these as a win-win.
We have these agreements with, let's say, ServiceNow, Salesforce, SAP with the recent partnership as well as
Workday. These products continue to drive our broader mission to be at the center of all of the data needs that
our customers have, and they just make the process of data collaboration between the SaaS vendors and
Snowflake just a whole lot easier. And we are very happy with these agreements.
And what this means is that Snowflake will continue to be the place for our customers to get like that single – that
stable single pane of glass sort of view on everything that matters to them. And obviously, with agentic AI and
agentic systems now, the value that you can get from the data is tremendous.
I can tell you from personal experience that I'm not thinking when I'm looking at my sales data agent, about
whether this data comes from Workday or from Salesforce or from our own systems, I can focus on the logic of
what needs to get done. And the rest of this stuff works as though it is magic. And so, Zero Copy agreements just
make data flow more smoothly, and I think are a big step forward for everybody involved, Snowflake, but most
importantly, our customers.

Q
Hey. This is [ph] Artie (00:36:31) on for Mark Murphy. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the strong
quarter and continued momentum. I know you've touched on this theme throughout the call here, but we spoke to
a Fortune 150 customer recently and they described Snowflake as the most important piece of their AI and data
strategy and explicitly stated that Snowflake budget is now tied to their AI budget, and they're kind of broadening
their adoption of products on the Snowflake platform.
So, my question is, are you kind of seeing that sort of tying explicitly from customers of their Snowflake
investments to the AI investments? And if so, how is this influencing their buying habits? Are they entering into
larger, longer-term contracts? Are they adopting more products or just any new customer patterns you're seeing
emerge? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yes. The strongest pattern that we have had to work hard and earned this year is to be that genuine player when
it comes to enterprise AI. And no amount of talking can make you that, you need project, products that produce
the magic. And so, building on earlier products like Cortex Analyst as well as Cortex Search, Snowflake
Intelligence, the agentic platform that can use these different sub-products flexibly is the big unlock for us.
And what you're also seeing is a number of these customers have tried to string together agentic systems by, let's
say, creating MCP servers on tables and sticking them into our foundation model, and then they realize that
solutions like that don't actually work all that effectively.
Part of what we provide are systems that can help them thoughtfully structure the data that then needs to be
exposed to an AI agent, and a careful amount of tuning that makes sure that these systems are fail-safe that
they're reliable and can actually answer the questions they are supposed to.
We also work with our customers on things like unheralded, but really important things like eval, where they can
judge ongoing performance, so that they know that they're actually making their systems better. It's a combination
of all of this expertise. Yes, the partnership with the big foundation model providers to bring the best models as
part of Snowflake, combined with our unrivaled expertise in data and modeling to help them create AI products
that deliver value.
And if you combine that with products like Snowflake Intelligence that now like are clearly valuable and useful for
every business user, I think that's the narrative shift that you're seeing in a number of these companies. And
agentic AI is still evolving. We have a lot more to do.
That's part of the reason why I keep repeating being in the center of enterprise AI because we are already the
holders of the most valuable data that many of these enterprises have, and then we are bringing the power of AI
to get even more value from this data.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Thanks so much. Very insightful and narrative shift, I think is a great way to describe it.

Hey. This is Matt Martino on for Kash. Sridhar, I want to stick with the AI topic here. The number of customers
leveraging Snowflake AI is accelerating very, very quickly within your installed base, and you were able to pull
forward that $100 million in AI revenue, which very few of your peers have been able to do. From your
perspective, what about the Snowflake platform is allowing customers to really accelerate their AI journeys?
And maybe, secondarily, do you see the market increasingly standardizing around a smaller subset of platforms
to handle all their data requirements, given your commentary about Snowflake really sitting at the center of the AI
opportunity? Thanks a lot.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. I think, to take on your second question first, I think there is a lot of complexity in the data space. I know of
the number of different tools that Snowflake, the company itself has had to use to have an effective data strategy
and with things like Snowflake Intelligence and Streamlit, which we are very heavy users of, we are just able to do
more with Snowflake. And again, investments like Openflow or even Postgres are going to expand the aperture of
what we are able to tackle as the data platform.

Operator: Next question comes from Alex Zukin with the company, Wolf Research. Alex, your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alex Zukin Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah. Hey. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. Maybe for either of you, Brian or Sridhar, clearly, the
momentum that you're describing is showing up in bookings. So, I, just maybe better understanding the
confidence and conviction around – and maybe the direction of travel for the expansion rate as we continue to
see some of these go-lives and an explanation of how the consumption patterns, particularly as you start to see
customers leverage the AI portfolio and the other – and the multiproduct portfolio more broadly?
And then, Brian, any timing elements? Last quarter, it seemed like there was a little bit more of a one-time bump
or boost to product revenues from consumption from some very large deals in the quarter, but then this quarter,
you also had four super large deals. So, is there something where they maybe happened a little bit later? And last
quarter, they happened a little bit earlier that maybe drove that beat magnitude cadence to be a little lower?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
I can start with the first one. The virtuous cycle of a Snowflake customer is one in which they sign a deal. It has a
certain amount of slack capacity that is built into it, that our teams then use to expand into use cases that can
deliver value for our customers.

Q3 2026 Earnings Call 03-Dec-2025
And to actually address a previous question that I had left unaddressed, that was the first part of the previous
question. Part of what drives broad adoption of AI with Snowflake is that we make it easy to do. It's not a brand-
new system.
You don't have to resolve the existing problems like governance and access control. And we have made it super
easy to first build chat bots and then to build more complex agentic systems like Snowflake Intelligence, which is
why some 1,200 customers are already using Snowflake Intelligence.
And as we expand and deliver value, these then naturally result in more confidence in more conviction on the part
of the customer that they're getting value from Snowflake. And remember, in all of this, they don't have to make
any pre-commits towards AI, the value that they get is like, it has to be delivered by the products that they build on
top of Snowflake.
This risk-free approach driven by our consumption model is what makes AI super attractive for our customers on
top of Snowflake. We make it easy to use, we don't require them to commit and then they naturally expand out the
ones that are creating value.
And I'll just touch on the second part of your question, and I'll hand off to Brian. Large deals that we sign don't
tend to have immediate impact on revenue within the quarter. If anything, as soon as a large deal is signed, they
typically get a better discount. So, it tends to be slightly negative with respect to revenue.
But as I said, these are long-term cycles. Our customers, on average, sign deals with us once every two-and-a-
half years-ish on average. It's not really directly tied to consumption and within a quarter, and I would not read too
much into timing constraints like that. Brian?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian G. Robins A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Yes. Absolutely, Sridhar. I guess, I would emphasize that product revenue is still the leading indicator of our
business, and we saw that in really the migrations and increased use case wins. We're also happy with the
developments in AI, and also the data engineering workloads.
We look at the consumption patterns up until today to inform our view of Q4. The quarterly beats are less
indicative, especially in a consumption model. I would really look at the FY guidance as the best indication of the
long-term business trends for a consumption model.
Our view of the business over the last 90 days has improved. And I think you can see that in our annual raise.
This is also represented in the $7.9 billion in RPO, 37% year-over-year growth and all the new customer adds that
we talked about in the prepared remarks.

Analyst, Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.
Thank you for having me on. I guess, Sridhar, Brian, one for both of you, please. [ph] You've passed (00:46:45)
the $100 million consumption thresholds, really impressive to see that. I guess, what do you see as the next

milestone? And then could you just remind us what does that $100 million actually include? Is that equivalent to
the Cortex suite? Or are there other products that go into that $100 million of consumption that you achieved this
quarter? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. The $100 million is primarily the product suite, but it's the whole stack. It is Cortex AI and AI SQL. It's
accessible from SQL also as a REST API. And then the products that stack up on top of that Cortex Search and
Cortex Analyst, which are our unstructured and structured data products, respectively. And then Snowflake
Intelligence, which builds on these building blocks to provide an agentic solution for data products. That's roughly
the suite.
In terms of the next milestone, I think much broader adoption of Snowflake Intelligence is certainly that we are
driving. There is no reason for us to not have every single data set that is in Snowflake, be AI-ready, and you're
already seeing this play out in the collaboration space where instead of sharing a data set, you can, in fact, share
an agent on top of that data set, so that the recipient on the other side can straight out just start asking business
questions of this data without needing to build dashboards and so on. Obviously, in many situations, this data
flows through programmatically and will be combined with other data. But my point is making all data in Snowflake
AI consumable and making the act of making that AI consumable is something that we will be – honestly be
spending a lot of time on.
But the second and the third order impacts that I alluded to earlier, the pull-push analogy that I used. I think that's
where the impact is going to be a lot more profound. I think migrating from legacy systems, bringing data into
Snowflake using products like Openflow are being able to write data engineering workloads using our coding
agents. All of those are going to get accelerated. I think that's where you're going to see like tremendous value
that our customers can realize and tremendous potential for us as a business.

Brad Reback Q
Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great. Thanks very much. Sridhar, the results are very impressive. The booking is super great. The op margin
obviously down-ticked on the first half sales and marketing investment. As we look forward into next year and
beyond, how do you think about balancing the huge opportunity in front of you and the ability to drive margin
expansion? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
I think we live in fortunate times where this is not an either/or. We clearly invested pretty heavily in our sales and
marketing teams in the first two quarters because we saw a tremendous opportunity. And what we're going
through now is a maturation of the folks that are here, and we expect them to aid us substantially, but we have
also invested equally heavily in how do we make sure that we upskill our own labor force, whether it is engineers
or solution engineers. We have rolled out coding agents for the folks. I talked earlier about how we want to make
it super easy for every single rep, every single solution engineered to be able to do custom demos, custom POCs
for our customers. Obviously, we have a big services team as well, making them AI-native is a big transformation.

So, the way we will – the way we look at next year is, yes, we will continue to invest in the business, but I think
there is also substantial gains to be had in just how efficient we are as a company. And I don't think of this as an
either/or. We have had pretty healthy expansions in things like operating margin, but also things like SBC year-
over-year, and we will continue to press hard on those things.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian G. Robins A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. I'll just echo what Sridhar said. We can do both. It's not one or the other. Obviously, it's a really big market,
and we've delivered impressive growth, and we'll continue to do innovations in our product to drive that revenue
growth, but we'll do that responsibly.

Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Cikos with the company Needham. Mike, your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Cikos Q
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys, and Brian, congratulations again on the new role as CFO over at
Snowflake. Looking forward to working together here. My question comes back to, I think there's been a couple of
different attempts throughout this call at understanding, frankly, the magnitude of the product revenue upside
relative to the prior quarter, where, to be frank, last quarter was more significant, but I really, I attributed it or I
thought that you guys positioned it this last quarter, really saw some very large customer migrations, which is
outside your control. And so, the question is, when we think about the increased confidence you're talking about
for the year, the traction for data engineering and AI. Is it fair to think that 3Q here was just a strong execution
quarter, but maybe a more normalized return to typical migration activity?
And then secondarily, just while we have everyone on the phone here, Brian, I would love to get your perspective
on whether the guidance philosophy has changed at all the margin. Thanks again for my side and appreciate the
questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. I'll start with the first one. We've consistently told all of you that we view a 3% beat, as a very good beat,
and anytime we do much better than that, we go back. Obviously, the ML models recalibrate and recalibrate
ourselves back to the 3% beat. So – and there is also a natural variability in a consumption business because this
is literally the agglomeration of 12,000-plus enterprises deciding what they want to do with their data futures. And
so, I view the Q3 beat as actually still a very solid beat at some 2.5%. And yes, the Q2 beat, and we are upfront
with you about it, had some large migrations that also had one-time activities, but we also have cautioned to you
that large migrations are lumpy and not all that easy, not all that easy to predict. And that's roughly where we are.
And as we look at things like Q4, we approach it the exact same way. We do the best job that we can of trying to
figure out where we are going to land and use pretty much the same guidance philosophy as we have before.
Brian?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian G. Robins A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Sridhar. Just to echo what Sridhar said as well, the quarterly variability is not the right way to
evaluate the consumption model. Companies that do migrations, they don't do those due to our quarterly earnings
calls. They basically – we snap the chalk line and where they're at and their migrations are at. And so, we really

point you to the full year guide. And based on the behavior that we've seen up to the earnings call, we have the
confidence to raise our full year guide, the $51 million to 28% annual growth year-over-year.
Just from a guidance philosophy perspective, there's a number of things that I did when I first joined, but one of
the things I did was spend a lot of time with the team that wrote all the AI models. It does the forecasting on a
daily business of our revenue. Super impressive team, very detailed, and I can assure you that there will be no
change to the guidance philosophy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: The next question comes from Matt Hedberg with the company, RBC. Matt, your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Hedberg Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one for Sridhar. The $100 million AI run rate is super
impressive. Wondering, if you could give us just a rough sense for how quickly that's growing. And then maybe
more of a detailed question. On the heels of Crunchy Data, curious if you can comment about just now that you've
had more time, how customers thinking about that long-term balance of OLTP and OLAP within Snowflake?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. As I said, AI revenue is predominantly driven by the Cortex product suite, including Snowflake Intelligence.
This is among the fastest products to get adopted by our customers, because as I said, the value is very, very
clear as soon as someone uses Snowflake Intelligence. So, we expect to – we expect for this to continue to grow
quite well. We don't really want to guide to it or hint at that right now.
With respect to Crunchy Data, it will take us a couple of more months to get the product into GA. But all of the
early conversations that we have is that customers are very welcoming of Postgres support within Snowflake.
They view Snowflake as an incredibly robust and reliable data platform. And for many kinds of applications,
having them be hosted as part of the overall Snowflake deployment makes perfect sense for these folks.
For what it's worth, Unistore, which is our HTAP product, is also doing well. It addresses a different segment of
the transactional data space. And we will continue to have both of these. But I think bringing Postgres to market
will be an important step forward for us, especially for things like agentic solutions that need an OLTP store to
function effectively. So, there are a number of those kinds of use cases that we are actively working with our
customers on.

Operator: Our last question comes from Tyler Radke with the company, Citi. Tyler, your line is now open.

Tyler Radke Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks very much for squeezing me in. I'm really impressive to see roughly $1 billion of RPO bookings in the
quarter. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the three, nine-figure deals that you added in the quarter.
How are [ph] these sort of structured from a operation (00:58:31) perspective and are you expected to see
significant growth in those deals? In other words, were they large expansions?
And then just a follow-up for you, Brian. Anything we should be thinking about as it relates to FY 2027, whether
it's headwinds or tailwinds in the model? I know you're not giving guidance, but just as we think about [ph] new
(00:58:53) products, optimization headwinds, anything you'd call out. Thank you very much.

Q3 2026 Earnings Call 03-Dec-2025
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Well, as a matter of fact, Tyler, we had four, nine-figure deals this quarter. All of these folks are customers that
are spending significantly with Snowflake and are very positive about additional value that they can bring. But
bookings are an indicator of how much a customer thinks they're going to spend in the coming years. Product
revenue is the best indicator of how our collective customers are going to be spending on Snowflake next quarter.
And so, that's the thing that I would look at. Brian, do you want to take the last question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian G. Robins A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. Tyler, as you mentioned, we'll guide to FY 2027 on our next call. But what's really important is consumption
after the holiday season is the most important input for FY guidance for next year. And so, we'll need to see the
consumption behavior unfold in January, February, and that will give us better visibility to deliver that on our next
earnings call.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: At this time, I'd like to pass the conference back over to our host, Sridhar, for closing remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Thank you, everyone. Snowflake remains at the center of today's enterprise AI revolution. And we at Snowflake
are focused on empowering our customers throughout the end-to-end life cycle for data. This is an incredibly
exciting time for the company as we continue to reimagine what's possible with AI and push the boundaries of
innovation to lead in this new era. We continue to execute strongly as evidence of our product revenue growth
and strong outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2026, and we see a long runway of durable high growth and
continued margin expansion ahead. Thank you all.

Operator: That will conclude today's conference call. Thanks for your participation, and enjoy the rest of your
day.

Olivier Pomel
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning to go through our Q1 results and what was a solid
start to the year.
Let me begin with a review of our Q1 financial performance. Revenue was $762 million, an increase of 25% year-
over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended with about 30,500 customers, up from about
28,000 a year ago. We ended Q1 with about 3,770 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about
3,340 a year ago. These customers generated about 88% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of $244
million with a free cash flow margin of 32%.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 06-May-2025
Turning to platform adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. At the end of Q1, 83% of
customers were using two or more products, up from 82% a year ago. 51% of customers were using four or more
products, up from 47% a year ago; 28% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 23% a year
ago; and 13% of our customers were using eight or more products, up from 10% a year ago.
We are pleased to see that customers are adopting more products and I'd like to highlight two of our newer
products with you. First, Flex Logs is off to a fast start and now exceeds $50 million in ARR. Flex Logs has
achieved this milestone in six quarters, which is the fastest ramp we've seen to that level, and which echoes its
value to customers as well as the size of the log management market opportunity.
I'll also note that by adopting Flex Logs, our customers are adding new use cases at the right economics, and
these Flex Logs adopters ultimately spend more on Datadog log management as well as more on overall
platform.
Second, our database monitoring product is approaching the $50 million ARR level as well and is growing 60%
year-over-year. Database monitoring has now been adopted by over 5,000 customers. We are very excited about
the early traction we're seeing there and are doubling down on our investment into broader data observability as
we see strong demand signals in that area, and we'll come back to that in a few minutes.
Now let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. Overall, we saw trends for usage growth from existing customers
in Q1 that were in line with our expectations. We are seeing high growth in our AI cohort as well as consistent and
stable growth in the rest of the business.
We also had a strong bookings quarter with particularly strong execution in new logos and larger bookings. Dollar
bookings for new logos were up over 70% year-over-year and much stronger than our typical seasonal softness in
Q1. And on the large deal side, in Q1, we signed a total of 11 deals with a TCV of $10 million or more, up from
just one in the year ago quarter. As we continue to expand our business with larger customers.
Finally, churn has remained low, with gross revenue retention stable in the mid-to-high 90s, highlighting the
mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers.
Now moving on to R&D, we continue to see rising customer interest for next-gen AI observability and analysis. At
the end of Q1, more than 4,000 customers used one or more Datadog AI integrations, and this number has
doubled year-over-year.
With LLM observability, we are seeing continued growth in customers and usage as they seek to manage end-to-
end model performance, security and quality. I'll call out the fact that the number of companies using LLM
observability has more than doubled in the past six months. And we are adding to Bits AI with capabilities for
customers to take action with Workflow Automation and App Builder using next-gen AI to help our customers
remediate issues more quickly and move towards auto remediation in the future.
Zooming out, we're making progress on all of our AI initiatives, and you should expect more announcements in
this area at DASH, our user conference taking place in June.
Moving on to security, our teams have been very busy building out products and features for our customers'
DevSecOps needs. To give you a quick overview of our capabilities. First, we have a comprehensive set of
products to identify and manage vulnerabilities across software and infrastructure. In infrastructure, our cloud
security product identifies vulnerabilities in hosts, containers, Kubernetes clusters, and Infrastructure-as-Code.

Our security customers can use Agentless Scanning to cover their entire infrastructure stack in minutes, and
existing Datadog customers using our lightweight agent immediately gain deep, granular and timely security
visibility.
On the application vulnerability side, our Code Security product identifies vulnerabilities in code from development
to production, and for first-party code as well as third-party open-source libraries. This product area has launched
very recently and already has over 1,000 customers paying for the product. Because we bring visibility to
production workloads, we are uniquely positioned to identify which vulnerabilities are most critical in production
and break down silos between developers, DevOps and security teams.
Second, in security, as vulnerabilities face threats and attacks, our threat management product helps our
customer identify and remediate them. They can use our Cloud SIEM to identify threats in logs and they can
further protect from threats in infrastructure with workload protection and in software with app and API protection.
Finally, our customers use our Sensitive Data Scanner product to discover, classify and redact sensitive data at
scale across their logs, traces, events, user sessions, data stores, code and all the way to LLM prompts. While we
have much more to do, today, we are serving over 7,500 customers with our security products or about a quarter
of our total customer base, and over half of our Fortune 500 customers use our security products, a good sign of
our opportunities with the largest enterprises.
Now moving on from security, last month, we announced our plans to launch our latest data center in Australia.
We see a large opportunity to serve our Australian customers and help them meet local data resiliency, privacy
and security requirements.
Finally, we recently announced a couple of acquisitions. First, we acquired Eppo, a next-generation feature
management and experimentation platform. The Eppo platform helps increase the velocity of releases while also
lowering risk by helping customers to release and validate features in a controlled manner. Eppo augments our
efforts in Product Analytics, helping customers improve user experience and tie feature performance to business
outcomes.
More broadly, we see automated experimentation as a key part of modern application development. With the
rapid adoption of AI-generated code as well as more and more of the application logic itself being implemented
with non-deterministic AI models.
Second, we also acquired Metaplane, a data observability platform built for modern data teams. Metaplane helps
prevent, detect and resolve data availability and quality issues across the company's data warehouses and data
pipelines. We've seen for several years now that data freshness and quality were critical for applications and
business analytics, and we believe that they are now becoming key enablers of the creation of new enterprise AI
workloads, which is why we intend to integrate the Metaplane capabilities into our end-to-end data observability
offerings.
We are very excited to welcome both the Metaplane and the Eppo teams to Datadog, as we have a lot to build
together. And that's it for product and engineering. Our teams are very hard at work this quarter and we're looking
forward to sharing many new products and feature announcements at our DASH user conference on June 10 and
11 in New York City.
Now let's move on to sales and marketing. As I mentioned earlier, we had a number of great new logo wins and
customer expansions this quarter. So let's go through a few of those. First, we landed a seven-figure annualized

deal with one of the largest US car manufacturers. This customer has a complex hybrid environment, including
on-prem, multiple clouds, in-car IoT and mobile apps. They expect to unify observability across teams and across
all their tech stacks while accelerating root cause analysis. And they are starting with 13 Datadog products,
consolidating a dozen tool and rolling out to dozens of business units.
Next, we landed a seven-figure annualized deal with a major Latin American bank. They expect to use our unified
observability to reduce operational costs and enable autonomy for departments that previously had to depend on
specialized teams for visibility. This customer is starting with six Datadog products and is replacing three existing
tools.
Next, we landed a seven-figure annualized deal with a major American tech supplies company. This customer
struggled with tool sprawl and limited user adoption. With Datadog, they expect to save over $1 million every
year, both in engineering time and avoidance of lost revenue. This customer is starting with 11 Datadog products,
including Cloud SIEM and is replacing seven commercial tools.
Next, we welcome back an insurance tech customer with a six-figure annualized deal. This customer found that
their previous observability tool involved manual workflows and customization, a high operational overhead and
user frustration and alert fatigue. By returning to Datadog, they expect to benefit from Datadog's ease of use and
out-of-the-box capabilities while using our built-in usage controls to manage observability and cloud costs. This
customer now expects to use Flex Logs, Cloud Cost Management and On-Call among the 10 products they plan
to adopt.
Next, we signed a seven-figure annualized expansion with one of the largest US health insurers. This customer is
using Datadog across dozens of business units to support millions of customers. More recently, they have been
using Datadog to significantly improve customer experience and reduce time-consuming and expensive outages.
As an example, one team estimated reductions in mean time to resolution from three to four hours down to three
to four minutes by using Datadog. With this expansion, this customer is using 17 products in the Datadog
platform, including the full Datadog security suite.
Finally, we signed a seven-figure expansion as an annualized contract with a leading next-gen AI company. This
customer needs to reduce tool fragmentation to keep on top of its hyper-growth in usage and employee head
count. With this expansion, the customer will use five Datadog products and will replace a commercial tool for
APM and Log Management. And that's it for another productive quarter from our go-to-market teams.
Before I turn it over to David for a financial review, let's have a few words on our longer-term outlook. We
recognize that there are many crosscurrents impacting the global economy right now, but our view of our long-
term market opportunities remains unchanged. We continue to believe digital transformation and cloud migration
are long-term secular growth drivers of our business as well as critical for every company to deliver value and
gain competitive advantage. And we continue to focus on delivering innovation and value to our customers
against their mission-critical needs, including the AI efforts.
Now more than ever, we feel ideally positioned to have customers of every size and in every industry to
transform, innovate and drive value through technology adoption.
And with that, I will turn it over to our CFO, David.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 06-May-2025
David M. Obstler
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Thanks, Olivier. Q1 revenue was $762 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 3% quarter-over-quarter. To dive
into some of the drivers of Q1 revenue growth: first, overall, we saw trends for usage growth from existing
customers, in line with our expectations and similar to the second half of 2024. We saw a continued rise in
contribution from AI-native customers who represented about 8.5% of Q1 ARR, up from about 6% of ARR last
quarter and up from about 3.5% of ARR in the year-ago quarter. AI-native customers contributed about 6 points of
year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 versus about 5 points last quarter and about 2 points in the year-ago
quarter.
We continue to believe that adoption of AI will benefit Datadog in the long-term, but we remain mindful that we
may see volatility in our revenue growth on the backdrop of long-term volume growth from this cohort, as
customers renew with us on different terms and as they may choose to optimize cloud and observability usage.
Next, regarding usage growth by customer segment, year-over-year usage growth with our enterprise customers
remain healthy. It's a bit lower than last quarter, which we see as a product of a volatility that can occur among
customers from quarter-to-quarter. Meanwhile, we saw strong booking activity from our enterprise customers in
Q1. And as Olivier noted, this included some large TCV deals.
From our SMB and mid-market customers, excluding the AI cohort, year-over-year usage growth was roughly
similar compared to last quarter. As a reminder, we define enterprise as customers with 5,000 employees or
more, mid-market as customers with 1,000 to 5,000 employees, and as SMB as customers with less than 1,000
employees.
Looking ahead to April, our usage growth was consistent with the year-to-date trends. As usual, we have
contemplated near-term trends in our guidance. Regarding retention metrics, our trailing 12-month net revenue
retention percentage was in the high [ph] 10% (00:17:25) in Q1, similar to last quarter. Finally, our trailing 12-
month gross retention revenue percentage remained stable in the mid-to-high 90s.
On new logos, gross new logo additions were roughly the same as in Q1 last year, but dollar new logos increased
70% year-over-year, indicating a higher average land in the SMB, mid-market and enterprise sectors. And our
pipeline for Q2 is strong and growing healthily year-over-year. As a reminder, our sales pipeline doesn't convert
into revenue immediately.
Now moving on to our financial results. Billings were $748 million, up 21% year-over-year. Remaining
performance obligations, or RPO, was $2.31 billion, up 33% year-over-year. And current RPI (sic) [RPO] growth
was about 30% year-over-year. RPO duration was roughly flat year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is
a better indication of our business trends than billings or RPO, as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on
the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer contracts.
Now let's review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP.
We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release.
First, gross profit in the quarter was $612 million and gross margin was 80.3%. This compares to a gross margin
of 81.7% in the last quarter and 83.3% in the year ago quarter. While gross margin remained in the range that we
have expected over the long term, our cloud hosting costs rose more quickly than we expected in Q1, as we
supported large growth spikes from some of our largest customers.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 06-May-2025
We also continue to innovate with new products and capabilities for our customers, which tend to put downward
pressure on gross margins in the short term. While we expect some of the costs to support customers to persist,
we are also focused on executing projects to improve our cloud cost efficiency and expect to realize savings
throughout the rest of the year.
Our Q1 OpEx grew 29% year-over-year, similar to the 30% last quarter and roughly as expected, as we continue
to execute on our hiring plans. As we have spoken about in previous quarters, it has been our plan to grow our
investments to pursue our long-term growth opportunities. And we've been successful in increasing sales rep
head count with over 25% year-over-year growth in total reps, including over 30% growth year-over-year in
enterprise reps. This investment has been weighted a little bit towards international expansion, where sales rep
head count growth was in the mid-30s percent year-over-year. We believe that there is white space to support this
growth and that we will keep seeing results as this capacity ramps as we have in the past.
In addition, we grew our R&D head count by over 30% year-over-year, with R&D expense as a percent of sales at
30% in Q1 so we can deliver on the rapid pace of innovation for our customers. As always, we continue to
prioritize our investments to balance near-term adjustments with our long-term plans and continue to look for
opportunities to optimize our operating costs. Q1 operating income was $167 million for a 22% operating margin
compared to 24% last quarter and 27% in the year ago quarter.
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $4.4 billion in cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations was $272 million in the quarter. And after taking
into consideration CapEx, capitalized software, free cash flow was $244 million for a free cash flow margin of
32%.
And now for our outlook for the second quarter and the full fiscal year 2025. First, our guidance philosophy overall
remains unchanged. As a reminder, we base our guidance on trends observed in recent months and apply
conservatism on these growth trends.
So for the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $787 million to $791 million, which represents
22% to 23% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $148 million to
$152 million, which implies an operating margin of 19%. As a reminder, in Q2, we will be hosting our DASH user
conference, which we estimate to cost about $13 million and which we have reflected in our operating income
guidance.
Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be $0.40 to $0.42 per share, based on approximately 361 million
weighted average diluted shares outstanding. To note, our weighted average diluted share count is expected to
decline sequentially as the shares related to the 2025 convertible note will be removed upon redemption.
For fiscal year 2025, in total, we expect revenue to be in the range of $3.215 billion to $3.235 billion, which
represents a growth rate of 20% to 21%. Now, we have raised our 2025 revenue guidance range by $40 million
related to the previous guidance, which incorporates higher revenues in the first half of 2025, based on our Q1
results and our visibility as of today into Q2. Our implied guidance in the second half of 2025 is roughly
unchanged.
Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $625 million to $645 million, which implies an
operating margin of 19% to 20%. Relative to our previous operating income guidance range of $655 million to
$675 million, the difference is mainly due to lower gross profit as a result of the previously discussed lower gross
profit margin, offset by higher revenues.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 06-May-2025
As we said before, we're focused on executing cost efficiencies in our cloud costs and believe our gross margins
will remain in our historical range. Overall, plans for OpEx investment are roughly unchanged, with continued
investment in hiring across R&D and sales and marketing.
There are some changes with distribution within that. We expect $15 million of higher international costs due to
currency rate changes and $10 million in net expected additional costs from our recently announced acquisition,
offset by other OpEx savings. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $1.67 to $1.71
per share, based on approximately 362 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
And finally, some additional notes on the guidance. The remaining approximately $635 million principal of our
2025 convertible notes will mature in June and we expect to redeem this mainly in cash. We estimate that the
GAAP purchase price from our Q2 acquisition activity will be about $180 million, of which we estimate about $110
million to be paid in cash during Q2.
We expect net interest and other income for the fiscal year 2025 to be approximately $140 million. And we expect
cash taxes to be about 1% of revenue or about $30 million to $35 million. We continue to apply a 21% non-GAAP
tax rate for 2025 and going forward.
And finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be in the 4% to 5% of
revenue range in the year.
Finally, to summarize, we are pleased with our execution in Q1. We are well positioned to help our existing and
prospective clients with their cloud migration and digital transformation journeys. And I want to thank Datadogs
worldwide for their efforts.
Now with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Thanks.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 06-May-2025
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our
first question comes from Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark R. Murphy Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you so much, and congratulations on a great performance. Olivier, we noticed the CEO of Anthropic
recently said that within 12 to 18 months, that AI is going to be writing 100% of all code. I'm sure there's a bit of
hyperbole there, but directionally, it's intriguing. Can you comment on the opportunity that might open up for
Datadog, if that sheer volume of applications being put into production starts to rise because AI writes so much
code so rapidly? And just does that AI generated code require more or less monitoring than human-written code?
And then I have a quick follow-up for David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. That's a great question. And there's definitely a big transition that is happening right now, like we see the
rise of AI-written code. We see it across our customers. We also see it inside of Datadog, where we've had very
rapid adoption of this technology as well. While I don't think this is going to replace all our software engineering,
and I'm pretty sure that Anthropic is still hiring software engineers too, I do expect big changes to come to the way
software is being shipped and being run this way.
The way we see it is that this means that there's a lot less value in writing the code itself. Like, everybody can do
it pretty quickly. You can do a lot of it. You can ask a machine to do a lot of it, and you complement it with a little
bit of your own work. But the real difficulty is in validating that code, making sure that it's safe, making sure it runs
well, that it's performing, and that it does what it's supposed to do for the business. Also, making sure that when
15 different people are changing the code at the same time, all of these different changes come together and
work the right way and you understand the way these different pieces interact in the way.
So the way we see it is, this moves a lot of the value from writing the code to observing it and understanding it in
production environment, which is what we do. So a lot of the investments we're making right now, including some
of the acquisitions we've announced, are built towards that and making sure that we're in the right spot so we can
tell you exactly what – every piece of code you've written, make sure that it works well, you understand it well, and
it does what it's supposed to do for the business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark R. Murphy Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, okay. Very interesting. And then, David, it's just amazing the booking stats, so impressive, 11 deals over
$10 million, only one a year ago. And then these big AI numbers, the combination there, it's just incredible. What
do you attribute that level of booking strengths to? It's a quarter where you had the specter of a trade war and it
seemed like it was weighing on business confidence. So I'm wondering if you can comment on the booking
strength.

Yeah. We entered the quarter with strong pipeline and I think it's consistent with our investments we're making in
go-to-market, where we're increasing our investments in enterprise and across the board. And so – and we've
been good about proving value to clients across the platform, allowing us to land larger, as you saw, consolidate
and add more value. I think that much of this is related to product strength and expansion of quota capacity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. And look, we – like everybody, we read the news and we see – we look hard for any signs of trouble in our
customer base. We haven't seen that in the deal-making so far. We – our sales cycles haven't been affected.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Our pipelines are growing healthily. And I can tell you that at least one of the customers we mentioned in the call,
one of the new lands, is also a company that is very affected by the tariffs and is having to moderate its own plans
for the future. I think what this tells you is that cloud migration and observability, in particular, are kind of
deflationary for these companies and they help – these are tools that help them save money and move faster.
And we are on the right side basically of the problem for them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
And to echo a little bit what Oli said in our prepared remarks, we continue to see that. We said we have, in Q2,
same quality of pipeline higher than last year. So it continues – we continue to have that situation.

Sanjit K. Singh Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to pick up where Mark left off. And as
we talk about kind of the core drivers, digital transformation, cloud migrations, what are the trend lines on the
cloud migration side? It seems to – I mean, based on your comment, Oli, it sounds like that's likely or could
actually pick up potentially going into a lower economic environment. So, in terms of just what we've seen through
the early parts of the year, what are the trend lines on core cloud migration?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
So it's very consistent. It's consistent with what we've seen before. It's also consistent with what you've heard
from the hyperscalers over the past couple of weeks. So, I would say it's steady, unremarkable. It's not really

trending up nor trending down right now, but we see the same desire from customers to move more into the cloud
and to lay the groundwork so they can also adopt AI because digital transformation and cloud migrations are
prerequisites for that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjit K. Singh Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Awesome. I want to talk a little bit about some of the expansion – additional expansion opportunities into data
observability. I mean, that's been a space that's been talked about sort of buzzy the last couple of years. I'm not
sure it's gotten super big just yet. Maybe just some of the – what – the vision is about moving into data
observability and how consequential of an opportunity could it be for Datadog?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
So, it's a space we've been watching for a while. Initially, we were worried that this was maybe a little bit too small
in the impact, because if we're just talking about debugging the availability of reports for executives, like it is
definitely valuable, but we thought it might be like a smaller market opportunity in the end.
What we see, though, is that the field is evolving into a big enabler or it can be the opposite of an enabler if you
don't do it right for building enterprise workloads – for building AI workloads, sorry. So in other words, making sure
the data is being extracted from the right place, transformed the right way and is being fed into the right AI model
on the other hand. And so we're building towards that with the acquisition of Metaplane we just announced.
And just to help you feed that into what we're doing, we already had some building blocks for data observability.
We built a Data Streams Monitoring product for streaming data that comes out of queue, such as Kafka, for
example. We built a Data Jobs Monitoring product that monitors Spark jobs and large data transformation jobs.
We have a database monitoring product that looks at the way you optimize queries and optimize database
performance and cost. And by adding data quality and data pipelines with Metaplane, we have a full suite
basically that allows our customers to manage everything from getting the data from their core data storage into
all of the products and AI workloads and reports they need to populate that data. And so we think it's a big
opportunity for us.

Perfect. Thank you. Congrats from me as well. Two quick questions, actually more for David this time. David, if
you think about the guidance, I know you've been – you've always been a conservative team. You raised it more
than the Q1 beat. So, obviously, you're kind of seeing good trends in Q2 there as well. What was the thinking

process in terms of kind of showing us that upside that you kind of might expect in Q2 versus kind of buffering
that, and just kind of given the uncertain environment? It's the first question.
Second question is on the gross margin change for the full year guidance. Can you just remind us, like –
obviously, that's three months after you guided the first time, can you remind us a little bit, like, what you saw
there and how – what's the action that you're taking there to kind of change that? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. So on the first question, we haven't changed any of our strategy towards guidance. We look at the recent
trends. I think it's important to note that we, obviously, beat in Q1 and we sort of looked at the run rate and still
discounted the current use – growth rate, so still put the conservativism into Q2. And this was the result of the
guide. So it indicates the pace of business and where we are, but still discounts the trends, as we always do.
And another thing that's important to note is because of the uncertainty in the market, we left the second half of
the year unchanged. We essentially have done that. There's no change in our strategy, as we do all the time, but
as we go out more in time, we have less visibility. So I think there's no change in philosophy. It's just sort of a
follow-through on our run rate.
In terms of gross margin, we – as a reminder, we've always said that our gross margins would fluctuate within the
range, and we've been in the range of the upper 70s to low 80s for a long time. And so what we – we sort of
designed the business that way. At some times, we're going to lean into investment, and in some cases, we'll
optimize.
In Q1, we – as we talked about, we did lean into investment and we also had a little more of a spiky pattern of –
from our customers, which we're learning about. We're learning as we grow in size how to deal with that. And so
from those learnings, we feel like on that we can do a bit – a better job in provisioning. And as we always said, we
run in the spectrum.
So I think there were higher cloud costs than we expected. It is largely due to those two factors. And we said
some of that'll persist and some of it we will work on optimizing. This is no different than – on that sort of pattern
than we have over time of growth and then optimization. Oli?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. And just to echo that, we have the same engineers basically shipping functionality and optimizing
performance. And we – there's a certain range of margin we're comfortable with. I would say, last year, we were
very comfortable with where we were. Now we're getting a little bit less comfortable with what we've seen over the
last quarter.

And so we're shifting some resources from – towards optimization so we can write that. As David said, in addition
to shipping a lot of new functionality that might not be as optimized out of the gate as the rest in terms of the
system utilization, we also saw some spiky growth from some of our largest customers and that might continue,
and especially as they deploy new workload, but our job is to optimize. And we feel very confident that we can
remain in the range we've been in before for gross margin or even better in the future. There's no question about
that.

Kash Rangan Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question. Oli, one for you and one for you, David. Oli, when you look at the
AI market, certainly, it looks like we're about to move from training into inference. Where does that leave Datadog
from a product perspective, where you can add more consistent value without being optimized? And one for you,
David. As you look at the stepped-up research development, sales and marketing investments, how from a
financial perspective are we to see the incremental benefit of those incremental investments? Thank you so
much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. So, on the workloads turning more towards inference, so there's definitely more product to build there. So
we have a – so we built an LLM observability product that is being – that is getting increasing usage from
customers as they move into production. And we think there's more that we need to build both down the stack,
like closer to the GPUs, and up the stack, like closer to the agents that are being built on top of these models.
So, you should expect to hear more from us at our conference on those topics because there's, I think, quite a bit
to – that is emerging as a set of needs from customers as they move towards inference.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
And on the – on investments, I think you're seeing it, we're trying to report on it regularly when we're making
disclosures of being over $50 million – or being around $50 million in database and then in Flex. That is the
evidence of being able to monetize the investments in R&D and continue to do that in the various product
offerings. So that's how we look at that. And we've gotten a lot of evidence over the years and continue to report
on that.
And we always said that the investment for R&D takes two, sometimes three years to realize itself because of
building in products, but we're reporting on investments that we made previously and the result of that in products.

In sales and marketing, it's the same thing where we identify end markets or customers, which we [ph] haven't
have (00:41:48) covered, feel like we can add additional capacity. And there, we have to go through the ramp
period.
So the increase of capacity that we've been executing on, we said we'll pay back in sort of the year plus as we
ramp our reps and get returns. And we'll continue to report on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. And just as a quick anecdote, like we – so we talked about DB, database monitoring as a product that has
taken off. And that's really a product that shows the power of the platform. So, we have a product that is over $50
million or closing on $50 million in ARR with a large number of customers. And that's a product that was built
basically by 10 to 15 people. And that's just the ability for a small team to build on top of our platform and on top
of all of the existing services we have that already collect customer data and deliver the data to them, and to
make a large difference in terms of revenue in a short amount of time.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jake Roberge from William Blair. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jake Roberge Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Could you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing with the AI-native
cohort? It sounds like growth remains solid in that segment, but still some potential for optimization there. So
could you talk about what you're seeing from some of those AI-native contracts that have already come up for
renewal and just how those conversations have been trending?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. So, I mean the – all the contracts that come up for renewal, they're healthy. The trick with that cohort is that
it's growing fast. There's also a revenue concentration there. We now have our largest customer in that cohort
and they're growing very fast. And on the flip side of that, we also have a larger number of large customers that
are also growing. So we – I think we mentioned more than 10 customers now that are spending $1 million or more
with us in that AI-native cohort and that are also growing fast.
So, when you add up all of that, like the number of newer customers that are growing fast and some
concentration in one customer is larger than the others, like there is definitely some potential volatility there and
we want to be careful. We've seen that movie before. We've seen that with the cloud native a few years ago as
they were growing very, very fast out of COVID, and they had to optimize after that quite sharply.
Now, of course, the situation is different. Like, it's a small part of our business today, whereas a very large part of
our business was cloud native a few years ago, but we want to be mindful of what might happen next. And that's
also part of how we incorporate that revenue and its growth in terms of our guidance for the rest of the year.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 06-May-2025
Jake Roberge Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then, great to see the strong ramp in Flex Logs over the past year. Can you talk a little
bit more about what you're seeing in the log management market specifically? We've definitely been hearing
about some more disruption at the start of the year from the recent acquisitions in the space. So just curious if
you're seeing an even more meaningful opportunity on that front this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Oh, we see tremendous opportunity there. We validated that Flex Logs was really solving a big problem for
customers. We've also validated the fact that this was net new use cases for us. And this was not really just a
cheaper product that cannibalizes the rest of what we have. Like, we do see customers adopting Flex Logs and
then consuming a lot more of everything after that. So this is great for us.
We also see a ton of opportunity to displace some existing players in log management. We've built a lot of
functionality towards that to close whatever gap in functionality or specific implementation of functionality that
might have been perceived by customers on that end. And so we see a ton of opportunity there.
And one of the reasons we're growing the sales capacity in the way we are currently is that we see those
opportunities in the market. We see great return on investment when we deploy more sales capacity to go after
them because these tend to be large enterprise opportunities that require some sales capacity, and we intend to
fully capitalize on that. So we're super bullish about this.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregg Moskowitz Q
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC
Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions. I have two. I'll just ask them concurrently. First, the AI-native
cohorts, getting back to that, so the percentage of total ARR coming from this cohort rose really impressively. Just
so that we have a little better understanding of this dynamic because, Oli, you just mentioned or referenced
customer concentration. Can you say if the increase, from a percentage basis, was driven by perhaps one or two
of these larger customers or was it broader based than that?
And then, secondly, for David, just given the second half step-up in sales and marketing investment that we saw
last year at Datadog that seems to have continued into 2025, how is your productivity tracking at this stage
compared to your expectations? Thank you.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 06-May-2025
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. So, I mean, look, on the AI side, we do have, as I mentioned, one customer larger than the others there,
they're contributing more of the new revenue than the others, but we see growth in the rest of the cohort as well.
So, again, it's fairly typical.
We've always had in every single one of our fast-growth cohort, we do have some form of revenue concentration.
And I remind you that a small fraction of our customers are the ones that pay us more than $100,000 of ARR and
they represent almost 90% of our revenue. So that's sort of how the business is structured. But we do – we are
careful about the size and the rate of growth of those customers there, which is also why we call attention to
potential volatility there in the future. David, do you want to take the next one?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. On sales, that's something we watch a lot. So once the reps are ramped, we look at productivity, and do we
have productivity from those added that are similar? And the answer is yes. It is due to where we're putting the
reps. We're not doing it sort of in a non-targeted way. We're looking at territories.
So when we see ramps rep – reps ramp, that's a hard one, we see similar productivity. And that gives us the
signal that we are doing the right thing and we can continue to add additional reps. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Just as a quick reminder, when you think of growing capacity, I think it's a little bit different for sales than it is from
engineering. For engineering, you can do it in a top-down fashion. You can decide how much you're going to grow
the team and then you can distribute your engineering on different types of products after that, more or less.
On the sales side, you need to do it in the bottom-up fashion because you need to understand which territories
can carry how many new reps, which ones have the right productivities, which one have the right market
opportunity, and where you're going to put people. So it's not as easy as saying we're going to grow the team by
30%. You actually need to figure out who's going to go where and how you're going to grow this team and how
you're going to make everyone successful.
So, we've done the hard work for doing that. We've done it for many years now. And the growth in capacity we're
seeing today is a result of that.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 06-May-2025
Thanks. David, on the 25% to 30% sales capacity that you're seeing now, is that what you're continuing to plan
for, for the year? Do you expect that growth rate to fade as you get into the back half of the year? Just give us a
sense of the shape of that quota carrying ramp in 2025. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
We're continuing doing that, but what we see is that the ramp capacity, because we essentially have this 6-month,
12 months ramp. If our plans are realized, the investment in head count will translate into a higher ramp capacity
increase. That's dependent upon getting the right people, training and enabling the right people and retaining
them. But that's the idea, and we're hopeful for that.

ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kirk Materne Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning, guys. Oli, can you just talk about whether you've seen any discernible
change in terms of the AI-natives that you're working with, in terms of what you're helping them with? Meaning, I
assume it's – majority is training at this point in time. But I was curious if you're seeing inferencing come into the
equation in a bigger way or even if some of your bigger enterprise customers are starting to think a little bit more
about inferencing. Just trying to get a sense on where we stand on that front. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
For the AI natives, actually, what we help them with mostly is not training. It's running their applications and their
inference workloads as customer-facing. Because what's training for the AI-natives tends to be largely
homegrown one-off and different from – between each and every one of them.
We expect that as and if most other companies and enterprises do significant training that this will not be the
case. This will not be one-off and homegrown. But right now, it is still the AI-natives that do most of the training
and they still do it in a way that's largely homegrown.
So when we see growth on the AI-native cohorts, that's growth of AI adoption because that's growth of customer-
facing workloads by and large.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 06-May-2025
Okay. And then just one follow-up, maybe this is for David. Just I realize you guys are in investment mode right
now. I'm just kind of curious, internally, how do you think about AI from an efficiency perspective? Meaning, I think
Oli addressed it a little bit on the R&D side. But we've seen from other software companies that they are starting
to see real yield in terms of using AI internally that might be masked with you all, given the – just the growth rate
on your investments right now. But I'm just kind of curious, how you think about that perhaps longer-term relative
to where your margins are today versus where they could be over a longer period of time. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. And for right now, I think we're seeing the returns in productivity, whether that be salespeople getting more
information or R&D. We're essentially trying to create an environment where we're encouraging the various
departments to use it and learning from it. Long-term, there might well be efficiency gains, but there may be
efficiency gains that can be manifested in head count. But right now, we're essentially trying to make the head
count investment that we are making more efficient and more profitable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Remember, we're constrained by sales capacity and we're constrained by engineering capacity. So any gain of
productivity we gain right now are basically reinvested in producing more, whether that's on the revenue side or
on the product and engineering side.
Long-term, obviously, we are strong believers in the fact that AI is a big driver of efficiency. And we can see how it
can be – if you squint, you see that it can be 10 times cheaper to produce the same amount of software and
things like that. So I think we definitely are headed there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Ma from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Howard Ma Q
Analyst, Guggenheim Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you guys could reconcile the consumption downtick in the enterprise
segment versus the strong new logo ARR growth that I believe you said was over 70% year-over-year. Thank
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, there's no contradiction there. I think there's always variability in the usage. We see that month-to-
month, we see that quarter-to-quarter. And what we see there is within the bounds of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. We – obviously, we take a strong look. So I think the first one is what we talked about already, which is
product sales capacity, winning market share in the market. The second one is we've always said we have some
volatility now. Back when we had post-COVID, we saw some correlation around broad parts of our customer
base, indicating that were broader trends. In this case, we've looked at it and it's sort of volatility of usage, but not
a broad trend.

Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. And remember also, when we say we have strong bookings, it takes time for bookings to turn into revenue
for us. For example, when we have a great new logo deal, we have mentioned a few on the call, that usage will
take many months to materialize and revenue will take months to materialize. But then, the back end of that, we
expect to see it grow far beyond what was the initial land with those customers. So there's definitely a timing
effect there.

Let me try this. Philosophically speaking, customers optimized in 2022 and 2023, are they still operating at fairly
optimized levels?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Well, customers, I think, are running tighter optimization cycles now. We – so we don't think the – the vast
majority of customers don't build as much overhang of unoptimized usage that they need to come back to later.
We do still see the same regular cycles, right? Typically, when they renew their cloud commitments or when they
renew their observability commitments is when they're going to look at what they need to optimize and come back
to it. But we think in general that that cycle has become much tighter for customers.

that. It is small anyway. Yeah. Yeah, but high expectation. Yeah.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Reback Q
Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great. Thanks very much. Oli, there's been growing kind of customer focus on bring your own cloud. How should
we think about your – well, I should – what are you thinking philosophically as it relates to that, maybe on-prem
workloads in general? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Well, I think it's two different things. There is on-prem workloads because some customers still have a lot of large
on-prem workloads that are not going anywhere, and we're seeing that, and we have new product offerings that
go squarely after that. So we can cover, from the cloud, the on-prem workloads in a way that is cost effective for
them and that they can use in conjunction with the monitoring of their own cloud environment. So that's one thing,
and we are addressing that. We see a big opportunity there.
The second thing is the desire for customers to run on their own infrastructure, whether it's clouds or some on-
premise version of a cloud. We think there's definitely a future where that becomes more important, especially if
there's more geopolitical separation between the various parts of the world. Philosophically, we go wherever
customers want us to go. So if that's the way they want to consume software in the end, that's definitely the way
we're going to deliver it.
We are testing right now some ways for customers to manage part of their data directly on their own cloud. We
have a new product that is being – in customers' hands for that. And if we see strong market pull for that and if we
see the world going in that direction, we'll definitely lean harder into that. So, for us, this can be a big opportunity
in the future.

Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yes, all of the above. That's good – and look, I'm happy this number is high, but it's – the reality is that it's
consistent. And sometimes a bit lower, sometimes a bit higher, but all of our customers are going up the curve
with us as they consolidate more and more of what they're doing into our platform and bring us more and more of
their workloads, and they grow with us.
Of course, we're also very happy to see some customers coming back. So, the one customer we mentioned on
the call here had decided to sort of build their own using some commercial open source, and they decided to
come back. And it's a motion we do see. We are very happy to see that, in the end, from customers who've tried
everything, including us in the competition, we're seen as being the best long-term choice. So – and maybe we
can close it on that.

Thanks, Brian. And thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a good quarter
and executed well against our large market opportunity. Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter results before
giving you a broader company update.
We generated revenue of $548.4 million, a 20% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance.
Atlas revenue grew 24% year-over-year, representing 71% of revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating
income of $112.5 million for a 21% non-GAAP operating margin. We ended the quarter with over 54,500
customers. For the full year, we crossed the $2 billion revenue mark while growing 19% and are roughly 20 times
the size we were the year before we went public.
Overall, we were pleased with our fourth quarter performance. We had a healthy new business quarter led by
continued strength and new workload acquisition within existing Atlas customers. In addition, we again benefited
from a greater-than-expected contribution from multiyear non-Atlas deals.
Moving on to Atlas consumption, the quarter played out better than our expectations, with consumption growth
stable compared to the year-ago period. Serge will discuss consumption trends in more detail. Finally, retention
rates remained strong in Q4, demonstrating the quality of our product and the mission criticality of our platform.
As I look into fiscal 2026, let me share with you what I see as the main drivers of our business. First, we expect
another strong year of new workload acquisition. As we've said many times in the past, in today's economy,
companies build competitive advantage through custom-built software. In fiscal 2026, we expect that customers
will continue to gravitate towards building their competitive differentiation on MongoDB.
Second, we expect to see stable consumption growth for Atlas in fiscal 2026 compared to fiscal 2025. Usage
growth to start fiscal 2026 is consistent with the environment we have seen in recent quarters. This consistency,
coupled with an improved fiscal 2025 cohort of workloads, gives us confidence that Atlas will continue to see
robust growth as it approaches the $2 billion run rate this year.
Third, as Serge will cover in more detail, we expect our non-Atlas business will represent a meaningful headwind
to our growth in fiscal 2026 because we expect fewer multiyear deals and because we see that, historically, non-
Atlas customers are deploying more of their incremental workloads on Atlas.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call 05-Mar-2025
Fourth, we are very excited about our long-term opportunity in AI, as I will explain a bit later. In fiscal 2026, we
expect our customers will continue on their AI journey from experimenting with new technology stacks to building
prototypes to deploying apps in production. We expect the progress to remain gradual as most enterprise
customers are still developing in-house skills to leverage AI effectively. Consequently, we expect the benefits of
AI to be only modestly incremental to revenue growth in fiscal 2026.
Fifth, we'll continue scaling our application modernization efforts. Historically, this segment of the market was not
widely available to us because of the effort, cost and risk of modernizing old and complex custom applications. In
fiscal 2025, our pilots demonstrated that AI tooling combined with services can reduce the cycle time of
modernization. This year, we'll expand our customer engagements so that app modernization can meaningfully
contribute to our new business growth in fiscal 2027 and beyond.
To start with, and based on customer demand, we are specifically targeting Java apps running on Oracle, which
often have thousands of complex stored procedures that need to be understood, converted and tested to
successfully modernize the application. We address this through a combination of AI tools and agents, along with
inspection verification by delivery teams. Though the complexity of this work is high, the revenue opportunity for
modernizing these applications is significant. For example, we successfully modernized a financial application for
one of the largest ISVs in Europe, and we're now in talks to modernize the majority of their legacy estate.
As I take a step back, I see fiscal 2026 as a year of solid Atlas growth, enabled by a large market superior product
and strong go-to-market execution. We expect continued strong win rates as we acquire incremental workloads
across our customer base. We will continue building on our core land-and-expand go-to-market motion to further
accelerate workload acquisition.
In fiscal 2025, we saw improved sales force productivity, and we are forecasting continued improvements in fiscal
2026. In addition, we will continue investing to become a standard in more of our accounts. We are not market-
constrained in even our largest accounts. For example, we finished the year with 320 customers with over $1
million in ARR, a year-over-year growth rate of 24%. This reinforces our move up market. To that end, in fiscal
2026, we will make significant incremental investments in our strategic accounts program.
Looking beyond fiscal 2026, I'm incredibly excited about our long-term opportunity, particularly our opportunity to
address the expanded requirements of a database in the AI era. Let me tell you what we're seeing in our
customer base as they work to adopt AI. AI is ushering in a new era of accelerated change, and every company
will have to adapt. We're witnessing a once-in-a-generation shift that will fundamentally reshape industries,
accelerate the pace of innovation, and redefine competitive dynamics in ways we've never seen before. We joke
that the world will move so fast that tomorrow's plans will happen yesterday. The winners will be those companies
that can transform and adapt quickly to this new pace of change. Those cannot will fall rapidly behind.
AI is transforming software from a static tool into a dynamic decision-making partner. No longer limited to
predefined tasks, AI-powered applications will continuously learn from real-time data, but this software can only
adapt as fast as the data Infrastructure is built on, and legacy systems simply cannot keep up. Legacy technology
stacks were not designed for continuous adaptation. Complex architectures, batch processing and rigid data
models create friction at every step, slowing development, limiting organizations' ability to act quickly, and making
even small updates time consuming and risky. AI will only magnify these challenges.
MongoDB was built for change. MongoDB was designed from the outset to remove the constraints of legacy
databases, enabling businesses to scale, adapt and innovate at AI speed. Our flexible document model handles
all types of data, while seamlessly scalability ensures high performance for unpredictable workloads.

With the Voyage AI acquisition, MongoDB makes AI applications more trustworthy by pairing real-time data and
sophisticated embedding and retrieval models that ensure accurate and relevant results. We also simplify AI
development by natively including vector and tech search directly in the database, providing a seamless
developer experience that reduces cognitive load, system complexity, risk and operational overhead, all with the
transactional, operational and security benefits intrinsic to MongoDB.
But technology alone isn't enough. MongoDB provides a structured solution-oriented approach that addresses the
challenges customers have with the rapid evolution of AI technology, high complexity, and a lack of in-house
skills. We are focused on helping customers move from AI experimentation to production faster with best
practices that reduce risk and maximize impact.
Our decision to acquire Voyage AI addresses one of the biggest problems customers have when building and
deploying AI applications, the risk of hallucinations. The AI-powered applications excel where traditional software
often falls short, particularly in scenarios that require nuanced understanding, sophisticated reasoning and
interaction in natural language. This means they are uniquely capable of handling tasks that are more complex
and open ended.
But because AI models are probabilistic and not deterministic, they can hallucinate or generate false or
misleading information. This creates serious risks. Imagine a financial services agent that autonomously allocates
capital on behalf of its customers, or a cancer screening application in the hospital that analyzes scans to detect
early signs of pancreatic cancer. For any mission-critical application, inaccurate or low-quality results are simply
not acceptable.
The best way to ensure accurate results is through high-quality data retrieval, which ensures that not only the
most relevant information is extracted from an organization's data with precision, high-quality retrieval is enabled
by vector embedding and reranking models.
Voyage AI's embedding and reranking models are among the highest rated in the Hugging Face community for
retrieval, classification, clustering and reranking and are used by AI leaders like Anthropic, LangChain, Harvey,
and Replit. Voyage AI is led by Stanford Professor, Tengyu Ma, who has assembled a world-class AI research
team from our AI labs at Stanford, MIT, Berkeley and Princeton. With this acquisition, MongoDB will offer best-in-
class embedding and reranking models to power native AI retrieval.
Put simply, MongoDB democratizes the process of building trustworthy AI applications right out of the box.
Instead of cobbling together all the necessary piece parts, an operational data store, a vector database and
embedding and reranking models, MongoDB delivers all of it with a compelling developer experience. As a result,
MongoDB is redefining the database for the AI era.
Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base.
Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical projects on Atlas, leveraging the
full power of our platform, including Informatica, Sonos, Zebra Technologies and Grab.
Grab, Southeast Asia's leading super app, which provides everyday services like delivery, mobility, digital
financial services, and serves over 700 cities in eight Southeastern Asian countries, successfully migrated its key
app, GrabKios, to Atlas. Atlas provides Grab with an automated, scalable and secure platform which empowers
engineering teams to focus on product development to accommodate Grab's rapid growth. By leveraging Atlas,

Q4 2025 Earnings Call 05-Mar-2025
Grab achieved significant efficiency gains, saving around 50% of the time previously spent on database
maintenance.
The Associated Press, the Catalan Department of Health, Urban Outfitters and Lombard Odier are turning to
MongoDB to modernize applications. Urban Outfitters chose MongoDB as a database platform to provide a
flexible, scalable foundation for its infrastructure. With a vision of integrating data across systems for elevated and
consistent customer experiences, the retailer found legacy databases inadequate. By adopting Atlas and its
flexible document model, Urban Outfitters accelerated development, boosted scalability while seamlessly
integrating data. This transformation facilitated the introduction of AI-driven personalization and cutting-edge
search features, enriching the shopping experience across both digital and physical spaces.
Mature companies and start-ups alike are using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered
applications to their customers, including Swisscom, NTT Communications and Paychex. Swisscom,
Switzerland's leading provider of mobile, Internet and TV services deployed a new GenAI app in just 12 weeks
using Atlas. Swisscom implemented Atlas to power a RAG application for the e.foresight library, transforming
unstructured data such as reports, recordings and graphics into vector embeddings that large language models
can interpret. This enables Vector Search to find any relevant context, resulting in more accurate and tailored
responses for users.
In summary, we had a healthy Q4. We saw stabilizing Atlas consumption growth, along with a strong new
business quarter, and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our long-term opportunity. Fiscal 2026 is a
transition year as we execute on our go-to-market motion while investing to prepare to capture the AI opportunity,
both through greenfield AI applications and AI-assisted modernization of legacy applications. We want to
capitalize on a once-in-a-generation opportunity.
With that, here's Serge.

Interim Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
Thanks, Dev. I'll begin with a detailed review of our fourth quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the
first quarter and full fiscal year 2026. First, I will start with our fourth quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter
was $548.4 million, up 20% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance.
Shifting to our product mix, let's start with Atlas. Atlas grew 24% in the quarter compared to the previous year and
now represents 71% of total revenue compared to 68% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and 68% last quarter.
Atlas revenue is recognized primarily based on customer consumption of our platform, and that consumption is
closely related to end user activity of their applications.
Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. In Q4, consumption was ahead of our
expectations. If we compare this year's Q4 with Q4 of fiscal year 2024, both usage and consumption growth were
stable on a year-over-year basis. While this is only one quarter and consumption trends around the holidays can
be particularly volatile, we are encouraged to see signs of stability in consumption growth.
Turning to non-Atlas revenue. Non-Atlas came in ahead of our expectations, in part due to greater-than-expected
contribution from multiyear deals, as Dev mentioned. As you know, due to ASC 606, we recognize the entire term
license component of a multiyear contract at the start of that contract. This multiyear license revenue benefit was
over $10 million more than was contemplated in our Q4 guidance.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call 05-Mar-2025
We realized that ASC 606 introduces increased variability into our non-Atlas revenue, making it harder to
understand underlying trends. To address that, we wanted to provide some incremental color. If we look at non-
Atlas ARR growth rather than revenue, in Q4 of fiscal year 2025, the growth was in the mid-single digits year-
over-year compared to low double-digit growth in the year-ago period. We observed that customers who are
predominantly non-Atlas historically are deploying a growing share of incremental workloads on Atlas. In other
words, the revenue growth of those customers is increasingly showing up in Atlas.
Turning to customer growth. During the fourth quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900
sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 54,500, which is up from over 47,800 in the year-ago
period. Of our total customer count, over 7,500 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 7,000 in the
year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 53,100
customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 46,300 in the year-ago period. It's important to keep in mind
the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers
adding incremental Atlas workloads.
In Q4, our net ARR expansion rate was approximately 118%. The decline versus historical periods is attributable
to a smaller contribution from expanding customers. We ended the quarter with 2,396 customers with at least
$100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, up from 2,052 in the year-ago period. As Dev mentioned, we also finished
the year with 320 customers spending $1 million or more annualized on our platform compared to 259 a year ago.
Moving down the income statement, I will be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted.
Gross profit in the quarter was $411.7 million, representing a gross margin of 75%, which is down from 77% in the
year-ago period. Our year-over-year gross margin decline is driven in part by Atlas growing as a percent of the
overall business. Our income from operations was $112.5 million or a 21% operating margin for the fourth quarter
compared to a 15% margin in the year-ago period.
Our operating income results versus guidance benefited from our revenue outperformance. In addition, we
benefited from timing of hiring around year-end. Net income in the fourth quarter was $108.4 million or $1.28 per
share, based on 84.6 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of
$71.1 million or $0.86 per share on 82.9 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the year-ago
period.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the fourth quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash
equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. During Q4, we also completed the redemption of our
2026 convertible notes, and as a result, our balance sheet is debt-free.
Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $50.5 million. After taking into consideration approximately $27.6
million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $22.9
million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $50.5 million in the year-ago period. Our Q4 CapEx
included approximately $24 million for purchase of IPv4 addresses, as we discussed previously. This concludes
our IPv4 address purchases.
I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2026. For the first quarter, we expect
revenue to be in the range of $524 million to $529 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in
the range of $54 million to $58 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.67
based on 86 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call 05-Mar-2025
For the full fiscal year 2026, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.24 billion to $2.28 billion, non-GAAP
income from operations to be in the range of $210 million to $230 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to
be in the range of $2.44 and $2.62 based on 87.3 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2026 include a
non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%.
I'll now provide some more context on our guidance, starting with the full year. First, as Dev mentioned, we expect
a roughly stable Atlas consumption growth compared to fiscal year 2025. Atlas consumption will benefit from
stronger contributions from workloads acquired in fiscal year 2025 compared to the contribution that fiscal year
2024 workloads had last year. As you know, we made changes to sales compensation plans at the start of last
year to focus more on the size of new workloads acquired, and we believe that those changes are having the
desired impact.
Second, we expect our non-Atlas subscription revenue will be down in the high single digits for the year. The
primary reason is that we expect an approximately $50 million headwind for multiyear license revenue in fiscal
year 2026, an estimate that is based on a bottoms-up analysis of our non-Atlas renewal base. Simply put, after
two years of very strong multiyear performance, we expect the mix of multiyear non-Atlas revenue to not only be
lower than the last two years, but also below the historical trends. This is due to the fact that in fiscal year 2026,
we have a more limited set of large non-Atlas accounts that can sign multiyear deals.
Finally, I wanted to provide some context to better understand our operating margin guidance. We expect
operating margin of 10% at the midpoint of the range, down from 15% that we reported in fiscal year 2025. There
are three primary reasons for the margin decline.
First, the $50 million of fiscal year 2025 multiyear license revenue that won't repeat in fiscal year 2026 is very high
margin, making for a difficult margin compare. This will primarily impact the second half of the year.
Second, we are investing aggressively in R&D, inclusive of the recently announced acquisition of Voyage AI. We
see an opportunity to further distance ourselves from the competition in terms of performance and scalability and
to redefine what it means to be a database in the age of AI.
Third, we are increasing our marketing investments, specifically to drive improved awareness and understanding
of MongoDB's capabilities. Our goal is to better educate new and existing customers on the full power of our
platform and highlight the widening gap between us and the legacy competitors.
Moving on to our Q1 guidance, a few things to keep in mind. First, we expect Atlas revenue to be flat to slightly up
sequentially. Please keep in mind that Q1 has three fewer days than Q4. Also, the typical seasonally slower Atlas
consumption growth during the holidays has a bigger impact on incremental Q1 revenue than it did in Q4, thereby
negatively impacting sequential revenue growth.
Second, we expect to see a meaningful sequential decline in EA revenue. As discussed in the past, Q4 is our
seasonally highest quarter in terms of our EA renewal base, which is a strong indicator of our ability to win new
EA business. In Q1, the EA renewal base is sequentially much lower.
Third, we expect operating income to decline sequentially due to the lower revenue as well as our increased pace
of hiring.

Finally, let me address how the acquisition of Voyage AI will impact our financials. We disclosed last week that
the total consideration was $220 million. Most Voyage shareholders received the consideration in MongoDB
stock, with only $20 million being paid out in cash. To offset the dilutive impact of the acquisition, today, we are
announcing that our board has authorized a $200 million stock buyback.
In fiscal year 2026, we expect an immaterial amount of revenue from the acquisition as we work to expand the
reach of the technology and integrate it into the MongoDB database. On the expense side, we intend to grow the
Voyage team to accelerate innovation and help with integration. These expenses will show up in the R&D line in
our income statement and will be modestly dilutive to operating margin for the year.
To summarize, MongoDB delivered strong fourth quarter results. We are pleased with our ability to win new
business and see stable consumption trends in Atlas. We remain incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead,
and we'll continue to invest responsibly to maximize our long-term value.
With that, we'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow
with Barclays. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raimo Lenschow Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Perfect. Thank you. Two quick questions for me. One, on the multiyear guidance or the multiyear situation. Like, if
you look like this quarter and the quarters before, you overperformed there. The guidance is, obviously, your
expense was slightly weaker because you have a lower renewal portfolio. Is it just a portfolio or do you see a
change in trend there, Dev? So is it just a mechanical problem or is it mechanical situation or is there also a
change in behavior? And then I had one follow-up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Srdjan Tanjga A
Interim Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. So Raimo, why don't I take that one? Thank you for the question. So let me just make sure that I repeat
and level set. So in fiscal year 2024, we had exceptionally strong multiyear performance led by our Alibaba deal.
And going into fiscal year 2025, we expected a $40 million headwind based on the assumption that fiscal year
2025 would be in line with the long-term trends.
Instead, after strong Q3 and Q4, the ultimate headwind was significantly lower than that $40 million. And that
creates the renewal base effect that sets us up for fiscal year 2026. So what I mean by that is because we've
done so many more multiyear deals in fiscal year 2024 and 2025, the renewal base and the opportunity is just
much lower to begin with. So it's not a change in trends. In fact, we assume same conversion rates as historically.
It's just the opportunity set is lower in fiscal year 2026.

Okay. Perfect. And then if you think about the Voyage acquisition, like how do we think about that in terms of
getting that into the organization and into the market? Is that kind of going to be like an attachment to what you
were doing or do you think it's going to be sold broader than just into the MongoDB installed base? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Thanks, Raimo. I'll take that question. Today, Voyage AI, it does offers models to other third-parties, and we will
continue to do that. We think it's important for people to have access to the best-in-class models. We also believe
that that will be a great way to bring people new to MongoDB into the MongoDB sphere, and that's a way for us.
There will be in the short to medium term, a better together story where we will basically integrate Voyage AI into
the MongoDB platform and do things like auto embeddings, where data will be embedded as soon as it's basically
entered into the MongoDB platform, which will make a developer's life that much easier versus having to go to
some third-party to get the data embedded and then to use our vector store.
And then we have a bunch of other things that we plan to do in terms of the product road map, in terms of more
sophisticated models, more domain-specific models, et cetera. And we'll talk about that in future calls. But we do
want to make this available to all customers, including people who are not MongoDB customers today, and we
think that's good for the business long term.

Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, and that will come from the line of Sanjit Singh with
Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Theodor J. Thun Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. You got Theo Thun on for Sanjit. Maybe with my first question building on [ph] the timelines
(00:28:11) on Voyage AI. When you think about the decision to acquire Voyage AI, could you sort of double click
again on the reasons and particularly with a look on your portfolio, what were the aspects that either existing or
new customers couldn't do with your portfolio that they can now pursue with the technology that you acquired
through the Voyage AI?
And then as a second question, as it relates to your operating expense guidance that's implied in your
investments there. Last quarter, you talked a lot about reallocating investments. So I'd be curious just if you can
double click on what's changed over the last 90 days that really pushed you to make those incremental
investments from. I appreciate the reasons that you gave. Some of those like the $50 million multiyear. Dev, you
probably had some visibility on that 90 days ago. So sort of what has changed in those 90 days that pushed you
to make those incremental investments?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
So, great. I'll start. I'll address the Voyage AI question, then I'll hand it off to Serge to talk about OpEx. So
stepping back and just thinking from a customer's perspective, one of the main reasons what gives customers
pause in terms of deploying mission-critical AI use cases is the risk of hallucinations. Because AI systems are
probabilistic, you can't always guarantee what the output will be. And if you're in a regulated industry, whether it's
financial services of healthcare or other industries where precision of the response or the quality of response
really matters, it really prevents people from deploying these production-level AI use cases.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call 05-Mar-2025
So the reason we acquired Voyage AI is to provide what's called embedding and reranking models. And let me
just explain how this all works. So think about the LLM as the brain. Think about the database as about your
memory and the state of how things are. And then think about embeddings as an ability to find the right
information for the right question.
So imagine you have a very smart person, say, like Albert Einstein on your staff and you're asking him, in this
case the LLM, a particular question. While Einstein still needs to go do some homework based on what the
question is about finding some information before he can formulate an answer, rather than reading every book in
the library, what the embedding models do is essentially act like a librarian pointing Einstein to the right section,
the right aisle, the right shelf, the right books, and the right chapter and the right page to get the exact information
to formulate an accurate and high-quality response.
So the performance gains you get by leveraging embedding models is significant. And even embedding models
themselves have different qualities. And Voyage AI's embedding models are typically the top-rank models on
Hugging Face. So we know a lot of ISVs have already reached out to us since the acquisition saying they
switched to Voyage from other model providers and they got far better performance. So the value of Voyage is
being able to increase the quality and hence the trustworthiness of these AI applications that people are building
in order to serve the most demanding and mission-critical use cases.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Srdjan Tanjga A
Interim Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. And I'll take the OpEx question. So you're absolutely right. We are both reallocating and reinvesting at the
same time. And so, 90 days ago, we talked about some reallocations in our sales and marketing line where we're
reducing our investments in the mid-market in order to deploy those resources in the upmarket. And then we also
talked about discontinuing or deemphasizing a few products so that we can focus more on the remaining portfolio
where we see the traction and the opportunity.
We are investing over and above what we're reallocating, and that was the plan all along. And the reason for that
is because of the opportunity that we see. You've heard Dev talk in his prepared remarks about the unique
opportunity that AI will present for people to revisit their infrastructure stack. And we see that as a unique once-in-
a-lifetime opportunity that we want to capitalize on. And what we don't want to do as a management team is sit
here five years from now and wonder whether we invested enough to fully maximize our long-term opportunity.
And what gives us comfort in this investment is, frankly, our margins' track record. So if you go back and take a
step back and you go back as far as the IPO, our margins were in the negative 30%. And obviously, we've come
a long way in terms of growth and margin expansion at the same time. And even if you look more recently over
the last couple of years, at the moments when we slowed investments, we saw margins spike, including, frankly,
in Q4, where we printed 21% operating margin, which is in line with our long-term guidance.
So we have confidence that the economics of the business are strong and that the business scales. But it's about
investing at the right moment in time and the conviction that we have to really play offense and optimize on our
opportunities.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call 05-Mar-2025
Michael Cikos Q
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. I wanted to come back, I know we're talking about the Atlas
consumption trends and how they're shaking out where we sit today. Just curious, when we think about the full
year, you guys are talking about taking most recent couple of quarters as far as how that consumption has played
out. And is there anything specific to Q4 consumption that started to drive this dynamic on the growth? I'm
interested in what you would point to. Was it the improving sales initiatives in the cohorts you guys are capturing
or is there something else you could point out to on that front?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Srdjan Tanjga A
Interim Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. I'll take a first [ph] shot at that (00:34:00), Mike. So when it comes to Q4, first of all, as we discussed in the
past, it's sort of the seasonally slowest quarter of the year in terms of consumption growth because we do see
both usage and consumption slowdown around the holidays, and we saw that happen. Q4 consumption was
lower than Q3. [indiscernible] (00:34:18-00:34:25) there's inherent volatility when it comes to the holiday season.
When it comes to stable consumption growth in fiscal year 2026, though, I would see consumption in three
components. So the first component is the base itself, which is obviously the largest [indiscernible] (00:34:39) but
it grows at a percentage rate because it consists of the oldest workloads. So that's layer one. And layer two is
workloads of the prior year. Those workloads in the current year are meaningfully sized and are still growing.
They are [indiscernible] (00:34:54-00:35:04) in any given year, you need the workloads of the prior year and the
workloads of the current year to basically offset the growing base effect. And so, last year, we were not able to do
that for three reasons.
Number one is the base itself slowed down, which was a macro phenomenon that we called out in Q1. Secondly,
fiscal year 2024 workloads didn't meet our expectations going into fiscal year 2025. And then new workloads in
fiscal year 2025 were off to a slow start, slightly for operational reasons. And that kind of was a headwind that we
faced for the rest of the year.
So now turning the calendar forward for this year, we are calling for stable macro environment and usage growth
in the base. Obviously, we don't have a crystal ball, but that's what we see currently. Then we're expecting more
for fiscal year 2025 workloads. We're optimistic that those are doing better based on the data that we have. And
because of our move up market, we expect to get more new workload ARR and sales productivity in fiscal year
2026 cohort. And those two things ought to offset the fact that the base is again larger than it was a year ago and
result in stable consumption growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cikos Q
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC
Thank you for that, Serge. Really appreciate it. And for a follow-up here, I know that we're citing this $50 million
multiyear headwind as it relates to the non-Atlas business. Can you kind of chunk that up? Like, if I'm thinking
about a Q1, Q2, is there any way you can help us get a sense of what those headwinds are on a quarter-by-
quarter basis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Srdjan Tanjga A
Interim Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
It sort of is the mirror image of the outperformance that we've seen here in Q3 and Q4 that we called out. And so,
I would think of it as a back half-weighted phenomenon.

Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, and that will come from the line of Brent Bracelin with
Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brent A. Bracelin Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to double click on the Atlas. If we normalize for the unused credits last year,
the implied Atlas growth here in the low 20s is actually a bit of a bigger step down in growth. So could you just
revisit the growth levers as we think about Atlas here? I know it's a larger business going into this year than last,
but it does look like normalized growth after accounting for those unused credits last year is decelerating a little bit
more. Just curious why?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Srdjan Tanjga A
Interim Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. So I'm going to go through the puts and takes a little bit, but I think it will help with the math. So the first
thing I would reiterate is that, on average, we expect consumption growth in fiscal year 2026 to be stable with
what we've seen in fiscal year 2025. So that's point number one. Point number two is you have the total guidance
and then you can take the high single-digit rate of decline in the non-Atlas business. And that will give you a
sense of what's left in Atlas. And [ph] that fits (00:38:02) with the roughly stable Atlas consumption growth in fiscal
year 2026.
The final thing I would say is as you think about the growth in fiscal year 2025, just a reminder that what matters is
the exit rate as opposed to the average throughout the year because we have seen revenue slow down on a
year-over-year basis because we have had slower consumption in all quarters – consumption growth in all
quarters except Q4 of last year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brent A. Bracelin Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. And then, Dev, as a follow-up for you. We've seen AI workloads, I would argue, in an experimental phase
for the last two years. We're now seeing AI go into production, starting to see early signs of some of these agentic
functions show up in revenue. What's your expectation as you think about customer conversations, customers
that are in experimentation going to production? When do you expect to see a bit of a lift there on your business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yes. So again, we do see – I mean, we have some high-profile AI companies who are building on top of Atlas. I'm
not at liberty to name who they are. But in general, I would say that the AI journey for customers is going to be
gradual. I would say one is a lack of AI skills in their organizations. They really don't have a lot of experience, and
it's compounded by the rapid evolution of AI technology that they feel like it's very hard for them to kind of think
about like what stack to use and so on, so forth.
The second, as I mentioned early on the Voyage question, there's also a real worry about the trustworthiness of
lot of these applications. So I would say the use cases you're seeing are fairly simplistic, customer chat bots,

maybe document summarization, maybe some very simple agentic workflows. But I do think that that is – we are
in the early innings and I expect that sophistication to increase as people get more and more comfortable.
We think architecturally, we have a huge advantage over the competition. One, the document model really
supports different types of data, structured, semi-structured, unstructured. We embed search and Vector Search
onto a platform. No one else does that. Then we have now with the Voyage AI, we have the most accurate
embedding and reranking models to really address the quality and trust issue. And all this is going to be put
together in a very elegant developer experience that reduces friction and enables them to move fast.
So we feel we are really well positioned for this opportunity, and we're really excited. We are already obviously
excited about what Voyage brings to us and excited by what customers are telling us. But we do think it's going to
take some time because customers, again, are naturally getting their arms around this technology and starting
slowly.

Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, and that will come from the line of Karl Keirstead with
UBS. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Karl E. Keirstead Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. Dev, on the last call and even the prior one, you talked quite a bit about this go-to-market pivot where
you were pushing MongoDB to go after more opportunities upmarket. To what extent is that go-to-market
transition reflected in your guidance? Are you assuming some upside from that effort in your revenue guidance?
And conversely, does that require a decent amount of sales investments that might be a factor in your margin
guidance? And how is that effort going at a high level? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Karl. We're really pleased with the progress we're making, as evidenced by just
even the data point we shared on the $1 million customers. I mean, that customer count is growing faster than the
rest of our customer base. So we're already seeing dividends from the investments we're making up market. And
we did see sales productivity gains last year from the move up market. And so, we expect even further sales
productivity gains this year.
In terms of the margin, we actually reallocated investments in sales, moving resources from the mid-markets to
the upmarket. So I wouldn't say that there was a demonstrable increase in sales investments. The investments
are really more in R&D and driving more awareness of our platform and educating – spending more time
educating customers because we still find that a lot of people are still not completely aware of MongoDB's full
capabilities and also don't necessarily have the skills to use all of our capabilities. So you're seeing a lot of
investments going there. And that's what we're really focused on. But in terms of the move up market, we're really
happy with the results we're seeing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kingsley Crane Q
Analyst, Canaccord Genuity LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So again, on Voyage AI, you mentioned that technology is not enough in the
prepared remarks. So to what extent do you think feature sets like that of Voyage can drive workload creation
within AI apps? Or is that more market oriented? And then is Voyage additive in its ability to reduce vector storage
costs similar to your efforts in quantization?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. So a couple of points. I'm just stepping back. We see two big challenges that customers have. They have a
skills gap and then they have a trust gap with AI. Voyage AI addresses the trust gap, enabling to build high-quality
AI applications where the results they have a high degree of confidence in.
But the skills gap is still inherent to these organizations. So what we are doing is not just bringing technology, but
we're really taking a solutions approach where we're coming together with a combination technology, best
practices, experience, so that we can really help customers deal with their business problems, not just throw
technology at them. And customers really appreciate this approach. And so, you'll see us really take more of a
solution approach to help, for example, in modernizing their existing legacy applications as well as helping them
build new AI applications.
In terms of storage, yes, the advances we made in quantization really reduced the storage costs and improved
the performance of our vector store. I would say with – these embedding models are slightly different. What that's
doing is essentially helping really quickly find the precise information needed based on the query being posed to
the application or to the underlying LLM to get the best quality answer. So we really feel like this is all about like
increasing the trustworthiness and the accuracy through the accuracy of the results that are generated from these
AI applications.

Kingsley Crane Q

Great. Really helpful. And a quick follow-up. How did GCP partner influence deals fare in the quarter? You called
out strength last quarter and that you were looking to do more of them in Q4. Also saw that they made some cuts
more recently. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
No. Our relationship with Google Cloud is still very constructive and productive. I mean, generally, I would say our
relationship with all the hyperscalers is very positive, and so we're working with them depending on the
customers. I've seen some customers have relationship with only one hyperscaler. Sometimes they have
relationship with multiple hyperscalers. And we work closely with GCP as well as AWS and Azure, and I would
say all three are actually quite productive.

with Citizens Bank. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Pat Walravens Q
Analyst, Citizens JMP Securities LLC
Oh, great. Thank you. I was wondering if you could just step back for us and give us sort of the five-year trajectory
on non-Atlas? As I look at the growth rates going back, 2021 was 23%; 2022, 19%; 2023, 25%; 2024, 25.4%. So
was there a period there where it exceeded your expectations and then where it came in below what you thought?
What was the ebb and flow of non-Atlas?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. I wanted to say we don't really manage the business necessarily by product. We manage it by channel and
really work from a customer orientation working backwards. What we do see at the high end of the customer
segment is that customers do like choice. They don't necessarily believe that every workload will go to the cloud.
And in many cases, some customers are still very much focused on building their technology stack on-prem. In
fact, a lot of large banks in Europe and actually a number of banks here in the US have a predisposition to run
workloads on-prem.
So it's really about serving the customers' needs. The customers do like the ability to have choice on how they run
their workloads. But we do also see it, and this is what's called out in the prepared remarks, for those customers
who start with EA or have a significant amount of EA, we are seeing them – seeing more of those incremental
workloads move to Atlas. And some of these new capabilities like Voyage and all that will be available only on
Atlas. And so, there are some things that we're doing that you'll see customers probably inherently do more on
Atlas.
And I'll hand the – I'll let Serge comment on your question on the guide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Srdjan Tanjga A
Interim Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. So I think that – I would just stress a couple of things, Pat. One is we talked in prepared remarks about
non-Atlas ARR growth being in the mid-single digits year-over-year in Q4 and that being a slowdown from double
digits growth in Q4 of fiscal year 2024. And that's the phenomenon that Dev is talking about, which is that we are
seeing increasingly customers who are historically non-Atlas deploy incremental workloads on Atlas.
They do deploy incremental workloads on EA. That's why that line item continues growing, and we expect it to
continue growing. But we see more and more of it actually coming on Atlas. So if you look at the ARR of those
customers, it's actually growing more than what the just the non-Atlas component would suggest, and that's
baked into both the Atlas and the non-Atlas portion of the guide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Pat Walravens Q
Analyst, Citizens JMP Securities LLC
Okay. And then just as a follow-up and you might not be able to comment on this. But as we look out past 2026, I
know you don't run the business this way, but we do model it this way. So as we look out past 2026, should we
expect the growth to stay really muted?

Q4 2025 Earnings Call 05-Mar-2025
Srdjan Tanjga A
Interim Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. I would say two things. One is the puts and takes are the following. We do still have low market share even
in those customers who are predominantly non-Atlas. So we do expect to continue growing workloads that we can
acquire on in EA, number one. Number two, we do expect the move to the cloud to continue, so we do expect
those customers, for us to gain even more share in those customers by getting incremental Atlas workloads.
And then a bit of a question mark at this point is sort of how the app modernization initiative is going to play out.
We think that will benefit both Atlas and non-Atlas, or EA rather. And so, obviously, that's still nascent and it's sort
of hard to ascertain, but that actually ought to be helpful across the board.

Brad Sills Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Oh, great. Thank you so much. Question for you, Dev. You mentioned fiscal 2026 kind of being a year of
transition. Wanted to get your thoughts on what that means exactly? It seems to me that the consumption
patterns are stabilizing. You're seeing some traction with new workloads. Last year was a year of kind of go-to-
market changes. It feels like this would be the year where you would start to see some progress on some of the
transition items you saw last year. So maybe transition is a little bit strong is a way to describe this year. But I just
wanted to kind of double click on your thoughts on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. So let me be clear. I feel very bullish about the future of this business. I have not been excited like this for a
long time. I think the way people are building these new AI applications are ready-made for a platform like
MongoDB in terms of ability to handle different data types, the scalability of the platform, to be able to natively
support lexical and semantic search, and obviously now to be able to also give a very elegant experience to be
able to leverage embedding and reranking models. So that's why I feel very bullish. And I think this business can
grow meaningfully faster than it is today.
But we are obviously making the right investments, we believe the right investment to kind of position the
company for that growth. We're pleased to see that the Atlas business is stabilizing, and that was obviously
mentioned by both myself and Serge in the prepared remarks. I know that's been a question for a lot of investors.
I think obviously with the EA business, there's the puts and takes with this multiyear. But the long-term trends are
in our favor. It's a big market. We're going after essentially a big opportunity because customers are essentially
looking to run their business through custom software. And I believe that when we think about like a competitive
differentiation against the other players in this space, I think we are very, very differentiated and that will show up
in the numbers over time.

incrementally be beneficial to our revenue this year, but we expect them to be meaningful growth drivers in the
years beyond.

Brad Sills Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Wonderful. Thanks for that. And then would love to get your thoughts on where you're seeing new workload
strength that you called out. Any categories in particular? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. Actually, the short answer is we're seeing it everywhere. We're seeing it both at the high end of the market
as well as at the low end of the market. If you see our customer counts, our new customer counts for this past
quarter was quite strong. And so – and as we called out, our move up market is generating, our $1 million
customer count has grown faster than our overall customer base. So we're seeing results at both the top end and
the bottom end of the market.

Patrick Colville Q
Analyst, Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.
Thanks so much for taking my question. I guess, Dev, this one's for you, please. So MongoDB is obviously doing
a lot of things right. So I guess I just want to ask around the competitive environment as of today, how is
MongoDB competing with the hyperscalers and Postgres as of today? And is that any different to the competitive
environment, call it, this time a year ago, March 2024? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. Well, I'll say that – I'll make two main points and I'll explain what they are. One, a lot of people do compare
MongoDB to Postgres, and I think that's actually a false comparison because Postgres is just an OLTP database.
With MongoDB, the right comparison is Postgres plus Elastic plus something like Pinecone plus maybe like a
embedding model from like either like OpenAI or Cohere.
So when you package all those components together, you get a like-for-like comparison with MongoDB. And I
think obviously customers much prefer to have a much more elegant solution than trying to cobble all these
pieces together and try and figure out how to make it all work.
The second point I'd say is MongoDB is frankly a much better OLTP database than Postgres. Postgres is based
on a relational architecture. It's very rigid. It doesn't handle unstructured data well. It claims to support JSON data,
but the performance of anything north of like 2 kilobytes of JSON data, the performance of Postgres really suffers.
And it's not very scalable. And I think what Postgres is a beneficiary of is the lift and shift of Oracle and Sybase
and SQL Server because they're the open-source relational standard, but they're not exactly competing for the
same workloads we are.
Our win rates against Postgres are very high. When we talk to our salespeople, when we can explain the value
proposition of MongoDB against Postgres, our win rates are incredibly high, we just want to get into more battles.
And what we recognize is people who don't know MongoDB may just gravitate to Postgres as their solution

because they just don't know how to use MongoDB. And that's what we're working on in terms of generating more
awareness and infusing more skills into our existing customers as well as the new customers we want to come to
our platform.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick Colville Q
Analyst, Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.
Very helpful. And I guess just touch on the hyperscalers briefly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
The hyperscalers, they have their own variants of Postgres offerings and they have their clones. I mean, we
haven't seen the clones as much lately. Our win rates against the clones are very, very high. This is something we
should talk about for a few years ago. But we seem to – our relation with the hyperscalers I mentioned on the
previous question, is actually very positive. Our salespeople partner with the hyperscalers all around the world.
And what we find is that together we win more business.
And yes, there may be situations where they try and lead with the first-party services, but usually we find that
when we partner with them that they're very accommodating and we all can do well working together. So I would
say there's no structural issue with the hyperscalers.

Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, and that will come from the line of Rishi Jaluria with
RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rishi Jaluria Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Wonderful. Thanks so much for taking my question. Dev, I want to follow up on a comment you made, which is a
lot of the Postgres success is from lift and shift of existing SQL applications. And we're seeing the same thing in
own checks. What needs to happen as companies think about net-new generative AI applications for them to
think about kind of reconstructing or rearchitecting those solutions from scratch, especially when they want to
leverage unstructured data? And what role can you play in kind of driving that conversation more towards rebuild
rather than just lift and shift?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. That's actually a good question. I mean, we think AI is fundamentally changing the game. And the reason
it's changing the game is that if we thought change was happening fast today, it's going to happen even faster in
the world of AI. That means every business will have to make sure that software is incredibly flexible, adaptable,
as they deal with all these new different modalities, as the use cases change in terms of being able to address
use cases that traditional software could not.
And what that means is that you need a data infrastructure and a data foundation that's designed to enable
change. MongoDB was built for change. The whole notion of our document model was enabled to have a very
flexible schema, so you can make changes quickly. Then obviously, over time, we added lexical search and then
semantic search through our vector database functionality.
So all of that comes out of the box. And now, with the Voyage AI acquisition, we bring all these piece parts
together, and we feel that staying on a relational database will no longer be a viable option, just given the rate of

change that every business will have to deal with. And they need a very flexible and adaptable data foundation,
and that's where we come in. Obviously, our job is to educate those customers on our advantages, but we feel –
and that's why I feel so bullish about our futures, because I think the puck is essentially coming to us just given
our architectural advantages in this space.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rishi Jaluria Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. That's really helpful, Dev. And then maybe just related to that, you've talked about the opportunity with
Relational Migrator in the past and really how AI can help in accelerating that, remapping the data schema, et
cetera. What sort of momentum have you seen with Relational Migrator? And maybe how should we be thinking
about that as a growth driver going forward? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. Our confidence and bullishness in this space is even higher today than it was before. I do want to say that
what we're going after is a very hard problem. And I should say we knew this from the start, right? For example,
when you're looking at a legacy app that's got hundreds – tens of thousands, if not thousands, if not tens of
thousands of stored procedures, being able to reason about that code, being able to decipher that code and
ultimately to convert that code takes – is a lot of effort.
And the good news is that we are seeing a lot of progress in that area. We see a lot of interest from our
customers in this area because they're in so much pain with all the technical debt that they've assumed. Second
is that when they think about the future and how they enable AI in these applications, there's no way they can do
this on their legacy platforms. And so, they're motivated to try and modernize as quickly as possible. We are
initially focused on Java apps running on Oracle because that seems to be the most pain that customers are
seeing. And we feel like FY 2026, this year, is we're going to scale out this work and then it's really going to start
showing up on our numbers in FY 2027.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. That is all the time we have for today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to
turn the call back over to Dev Ittycheria for any closing remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Thank you. Thank you for everyone for joining us today. I just want to remind and summarize that we had a really
strong quarter and year as we executed on a large opportunity. We expect this coming fiscal year to play out
similar to last year with healthy new business and stable Atlas consumption trends. We are more excited than
ever about the long-term outlook, particularly around our opportunity to address expanded requirements of a
database in the AI era.
And we'll continue to invest judiciously and focus on our execution to capture the long-term opportunity ahead of
us. So thank you for joining us, and we'll talk to you soon. Take care.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2025
Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we
will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
And for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave
Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.

David Fildes
Vice President, Investor Relations, Amazon.com, Inc.
Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2025 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is
Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you
to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary
on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the
comparable period of 2024.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, May 1, 2025, only and
will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors
that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC,
including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying
this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional

disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable
GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate
assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, tariff and trade
policies and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates,
regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth the Internet, online commerce, cloud services
and new and emerging technologies and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions,
restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and
therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Andy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $155.7 billion in revenue, up 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact
from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is $18.4 billion, up 20% year-over-year and trailing 12-month free
cash flow was $25.9 billion. We're pleased with our continued business progress but more importantly, with our
pace of innovation and additional improvement in our customer experiences.
In our stores business, we once again saw strong consumer resonance and our continued work on selection,
value and shipping speed. Our broad selection offers customers' choice across their shopping journeys. We
welcomed well-known brands such as Ara Rings, Michael Kors and The Ordinary as well as a new shopping
experience with Saks that offers a refined luxury assortment of fashion and beauty items from brands like Dolce &
Gabbana, Balmain, ERDEM, Giambattista Valli and Jason Wu collection.
As always, we're working to keep prices low. And with this being an uncertain moment for consumers, it's even
more important than it typically is. In Q1, we held deal events worldwide to help customers save over $500 million
across the Big Spring sale in the US and Canada, spring deal days in Europe, and Ramadan Eid sale events in
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the UAE. Prime members will have more opportunities to save throughout the
year, including at our 11th Prime Day event in July.
Over the past few years, we've made significant progress in making our fulfillment network more efficient and
cost-effective. We've shared many times that an important turning point was regionalizing our national fulfillment
network into regional hubs. By stocking items closer to where customers live, we're able to deliver more orders
faster, often in fewer packages and at lower delivery costs.
The next challenge was getting as many items as possible into these regional nodes. Our inbound network, which
is how we get items to each fulfillment center hasn't been architected to leverage this new regionalization
structure. So we redesigned it and just rolled out a new inbound architecture that expands the share of products
that we can place in each fulfillment center, improving delivery speeds and lowering our cost to serve.
In the first quarter, we once again set new delivery speed records with our fastest delivery ever for Prime
members around the world, and we delivered more items in the same day or next day in Q1 than any other
quarter in our history.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 01-May-2025
Looking ahead, we'll continue to refine our newly redesigned inbound network, build out our same-day delivery
sites and add additional robotics and automation throughout our buildings. You'll also see us expand the number
of delivery stations that we have in rural areas of the US, so we can get items to people who live in less densely
populated areas much more quickly.
I thought I'd share a few thoughts on the prospect of heightened tariffs on our stores business. Obviously, none of
us know exactly where tariffs will settle or when. We haven't seen any attenuation of demand yet. To some extent,
we've seen some heightened buying in certain categories that may indicate stocking up in advance of any
potential tariff impact.
We also have not seen the average selling price of retail items appreciably go up yet. Some of this reflects some
forward buying we did in our first-party selling, and some of that reflects some advanced inbounding our third-
party sellers have done, but a fair amount of this is that most sellers just haven't changed pricing yet. Again, this
could change depending on where tariffs settle.
Amazon is not uniquely susceptible to tariffs. As it relates to China, retailers who aren't buying directly from China
are typically buying from companies who themselves are buying from China marking these items up, rebranding
and selling to US consumers. These retailers are buying the product at a higher price than Chinese sellers selling
directly to US consumers in our marketplace. So, the total tariff will be higher for these retailers than for China
direct sellers.
It's also sometimes easy to forget what Amazon sells. We're not mostly selling high average selling price items
that we certainly sell a bunch. In the first quarter, our everyday essentials grew more than twice as fast as the rest
of our business and represented one out of every three units sold in the US on Amazon.
Even if you exclude Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh, Amazon is one of the largest grocers in the US with
over $100 billion in gross sales last year. People are buying a lot of their everyday essentials at Amazon. We also
have extremely large selection, hundreds of millions of unique SKUs, which means we're often able to weather
challenging conditions better than others.
When there are periods of discontinuity, substantial unexpected product trends emerge. Think about the
pandemic when items like masks, and hand sanitizer became big sellers. When you have the broadest selection
like we do and 2 million-plus global sellers like we do, you're better positioned to help customers find whatever
items matter to them at lower price points than elsewhere.
Finally, when there are uncertain environments, customers tend to choose the provider they trust most. Given our
really broad selection, low pricing and speedy delivery, we have emerged from these uncertain eras with more
relative market segment share than we started and better set up for the future. I'm optimistic this could happen
again.
Moving to a few words on Amazon Ads. We're working hard to be the best place for brands of all sizes to grow
their business. We are pleased with the strong growth on a very large base, generating $13.9 billion of revenue in
the quarter and growing 19% year-over-year. We're seeing strength across our broad portfolio of full funnel
advertising offerings that help advertisers reach an average ad-supported audience of more than 275 million in
the US alone.

This includes our top of funnel efforts to drive brand awareness, the bottom of funnel offerings where we measure
outcomes at the point of conversion. Amazon Ad provides brands with tools to reach targeted audiences in our
own entertainment properties such as Prime Video, Twitch and IMDb, in live sports such as NFL, NBA and
NASCAR, audio content such as Amazon Music and Wondery, and of course, in our store, as well as many other
external sites such as Pinterest and BuzzFeed.
All of our audience and measurement capabilities work for the ads we deliver across premium third-party
publishers through Amazon DSP and our secure clean rooms provide advertisers the ability to analyze data,
produce core marketing metrics and understand how their marketing performs across various channels. We
continue to see a lot of opportunity to further expand our full funnel capabilities for brands.
AWS grew 17% year-over-year in Q1 and now sits at a $117 billion annualized revenue run rate. We continue to
help organizations of all sizes accelerate their move to the cloud, helping to modernize their infrastructure at lower
cost and speed up innovation. We signed new AWS agreements with companies, including Adobe, Uber,
NASDAQ, Ericsson, Fujitsu, Cargill, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, General Dynamics Information Technology,
GE Vernova, Booz Allen Hamilton, NextEra Energy; Publicis Sapient, Elastic, Netsmart and many others.
It's useful to remember that more than 85% of the global IT spend is still on premises, so not in the cloud yet. It
seems pretty straightforward to me that this equation will flip in the next 10 years to 20 years. Before this
generation of AI, we thought AWS had the chance to ultimately be a multi-hundred billion dollar revenue run rate
business. We now think it could be even larger.
If you believe your mission is to make customers' lives easier and better every day, and you believe that every
customer experience will be reinvented with AI, you're going to invest very aggressively in AI, and that's what
we're doing. You can see that in the 1,000-plus AI applications we're building across Amazon. You can see that
with our next generation of Alexa, named Alexa+.
You can see that in how we're using AI in our fulfillment network, robotics, shopping, Prime Video and advertising
experiences. And you can see that in the building blocks, AWS is constructing for external and internal builders to
build their own AI solutions. We're not dabbling here. We're very intentionally giving builders the broadest possible
capabilities at every level of the AI stack cost effectively to use AI expansively across their businesses.
At the bottom layer for those building models, our new custom AI chip Trainium2 is starting to lay in capacity in
larger quantities with significant appeal and demand. While we offer customers the ability to do AI in multiple chip
providers and will for as long as I can foresee, customers doing AI at any significant scale realize that it can get
expensive quickly. So the 30% to 40% better price performance that Trainium2 offers versus other GPU-based
instances is compelling.
For AI to be as successful as we believe it can be, the price of inference needs to come down significantly. We
consider this part of our mission and responsibility to help make it so. At the middle layer, for those wanting to
leverage frontier models to build generative AI apps, Amazon Bedrock is our fully managed service that offers us
choice of high-performing foundation models with the most compelling set of features that make it easy to build
high-quality generative AI applications.
We continue to iterate quickly on Bedrock, adding Anthropic, Claude 3.7 Sonnet hybrid reasoning model, their
most intelligent model to-date and Meta's Llama 4 Family of models. We were also the first cloud service provider
to make DeepSeek-R1, Mistral AI's Pixtral Large generally available as a fully managed model.

And of course, we offer our own Amazon Nova state-of-the-art foundation models in Bedrock with the latest
premium model launching yesterday. They deliver frontier intelligence and industry-leading price performance and
we have thousands of customers already using them, including Slack, Siemens, Sumo Logic, Coinbase, FanDuel,
Glean and Blue Origin.
A few weeks ago, we released Amazon Nova Sonic, a new speech-to-speech foundation model that enables
developers to build voice-based AI applications that are highly accurate, expressive and human like. Nova Sonic
has lower word error rates and higher win rates over other comparable models for speech interactions.
The technology world is also abuzz about the potential of agents. To-date, virtually all of the agentic use cases
have been of the question-and-answer variety. Our intention is for agents to perform wide-ranging complex multi-
step tasks by organizing a trip or setting the lighting, temperature of music ambience in your house for dinner
guests or handling complex IT tasks to increase business productivity.
There haven't been action-oriented agents like this until Alexa+. With the technology to build these agents is still
quite primitive and accurate and requires constant human supervision. We've just released a research preview of
Amazon Nova Act, a new AI model trained to perform actions within a web browser. It enables developers to
break down complex workflows into reliable atomic commands like search or checkout or answer questions about
the screen. It also enables them to add more detailed instructions to these commands where needed, like don't
accept the insurance upsell.
Nova Act aims to move the current state-of-the-art accuracy of multistep agentic actions from 30% to 60% to 90-
plus percent with the right set of building blocks to build these action-oriented agents. At the very top of the stack
are the applications. This past quarter, Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for
accelerating software development and leveraging your own data launched a lightning fast new agentic coding
experience within the command line interface that can execute complex workflows autonomously. Customers are
loving this.
We also made generally available GitLab Duo with Amazon Q, enabling AI agents to assist multistep tasks such
as new feature development, code-based upgrades for Java 8 and 11, while also offering code review and unit
testing, all within the same familiar GitLab platform. Our AI business has a multibillion-dollar annual revenue run
rate continues to grow triple-digit year-over-year percentages and is still in its very early days.
While there is good reason for the high optimism about AI, I conclude my AWS comments with a reminder that
there is still so much on-premises infrastructure yet to be moved to the cloud. Infrastructure modernization is
much less sexy to talk about than AI, the fundamental to any company's technology and invention capabilities,
developer productivity, speed and cost structure. If for companies to realize the full potential of AI, they're going to
need their infrastructure and data in the cloud. I want to briefly mention a few other items.
As I've referenced a couple of times in Q1, we introduced Alexa+, our next-generation Alexa personal assistant is
meaningfully smarter and more capable than our prior self, can both answer virtually any question and take
actions and is free with Prime or available to non-Prime customers for $19.99 a month. We're just starting to roll
this out in the US, and we'll be expanding to additional countries later this year. People are really liking Alexa+
thus far.
We're excited and honored to be part of the joint venture that we'll be creating the next generation of the
esteemed James Bond film franchise. We recently named the claimed producer, Amy Pascal, and David Heyman
to produce the next James Bond movie.

Additionally, just a couple of days ago, Project Kuiper reached a significant milestone by launching our first
satellites into orbit with more being launched soon, and we expect to begin offering service to customers later this
year. I'm proud of what our teams around the world have delivered. We're excited about what we're inventing and
working on as we speak.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Olsavsky
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Amazon.com, Inc.
Thanks, Andy. I will begin with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $155.7 billion, a 10%
increase year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This equates to a $1.4 billion headwind from
foreign exchange year-over-year in the quarter. Worldwide operating income was $18.4 billion, approximately
$400 million above the high end of our guidance range. These results include one-time charges that impacted
North America and international operating income that I will discuss in a moment.
First, let's start with the net sales results for these segments. In the North America segment, first quarter revenue
was $92.9 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Our International segment revenue was $33.5 billion, also an
increase of 8% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Worldwide paid units grew 8% year-
over-year.
Our priority is to provide value to our customers across our businesses. In the first quarter, we held multiple deal
events around the world, which drove strong customer engagement. We saw broad-based strength across our
key business inputs, including record delivery speeds for Prime members enabled by improved inventory
placement.
Our vast selection gives customers choice across various price points, particularly in categories like grocery,
which includes everyday essentials. These are the items that people purchase most frequently. We partner with
millions of independent sellers from around the world. These selling partners are important contributors to our
broad selection. And worldwide third party selling unit mix was 61% in Q1, consistent with Q1 of last year.
Shifting to profitability. North America segment operating income was $5.8 billion, and International segment
operating income was $1 billion with operating margins of 6.3% in North America and 3% internationally.
As I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we recorded one-time charges related to some historical customer
returns has not yet been resolved and some costs to receive inventory that was pulled forward into Q1 ahead of
anticipated tariffs.
Without these charges, North America and International operating margins would have been approximately 90
basis points and 70 basis points higher or operating margins of 7.2% for North America and 3.7% for
International. We are pleased with how our teams continue to execute and deliver for customers.
In Q1, our newly rearchitected inbound network, drove productivity in our fulfillment and transportation network,
leading to better inventory placement and higher units per package and as a result, lower delivery costs.
Beyond Q1, we have a number of initiatives underway to continue improving our cost structure, such as fine-
tuning our inbound network, building out our same-day delivery sites, expanding our rural delivery network and
adding robotics and automation to our facilities. Better inventory placement remains a top priority.

Better placement drives more in-stock selection, reduces travel distances and speeds up delivery. And having
inventory in the right place at the right time increases the likelihood that multiple items can be combined in a
package, which helps reduce packaging and cost. Although progress won't always be linear, we have a good plan
to continue to drive improvement over time.
Shifting to advertising. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North America and
international segments. Advertising revenue grew 19% year-over-year. We're pleased with the accelerating
growth on an increasingly large base. We're seeing strong adoption across our full funnel advertising offering as
brands appreciate our ability to connect them with customers.
We'll also continue to invest in other long-term opportunities. These efforts have the potential to be important to
customers and Amazon in the future, including Kuiper, where we had our first launch of our production design
satellites earlier this week, and we'll be launching more satellites throughout the year.
We're closely monitoring the macroeconomic environment, including the impact of tariffs. We're planning for
various outcomes, and we've taken a number of actions to protect the customer experience. We're doing
everything we can to keep our prices low for customers in a way that makes economic sense.
Moving next to our AWS segment. Revenue was $29.3 billion in Q1, an increase of 17% year-over-year. AWS
now has an annualized revenue run rate of more than $117 billion. During the first quarter, we continued to see
growth in both generative AI business and non-generative AI offerings. As companies turned their attention to
newer initiatives, bring more workloads to the cloud, restart or accelerate existing migrations from on-premises to
the cloud and tap into the power of Generative AI.
AWS operating income was $11.5 billion and reflects our continued growth coupled with our focus on driving
efficiencies across the business. As we said before, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time,
driven in part by the level of investments we're making at any point in time, plan to bring on an increasing amount
of capacity in the back half of the year.
Now turning to our cash CapEx, which was $24.3 billion in Q1. The majority of this spend is to support the
growing need for technology infrastructure. It primarily relates to AWS as we invest to support demand for our AI
services and increasingly in custom silicon like Trainium as well as tech infrastructure to support our North
America and International segments.
We're also investing in our fulfillment and transportation network to support future growth and improve delivery
speeds and our cost structure. This investment will support growth for many years to come. We primarily focus
our comments on operating income, I'd like to point out that our first quarter net income of $17.1 billion includes a
pre-tax gain of $3.3 billion, included in non-operating income and it relates to our investment in Anthropic. This
activity is not related to Amazon's ongoing operations, but rather the result of the conversion of a portion of our
convertible notes to non-voting preferred stock.
Turning to Q2 guidance. As a reminder, our guidance considers a range of possibilities and takes into account Q1
results, trends in quarter-to-date results and expectations around the macroeconomic environment. Q2 net sales
are expected to be between $159 billion and $164 billion.

We estimate the year-over-year impact of changes in foreign exchange rates based on current rates, which we
expect to be a headwind of approximately 10 basis points in the quarter. As a reminder, global currencies can
fluctuate during the quarter.
Q2 operating income is expected to be between $13 billion and $17.5 billion. This estimate includes the impact of
our seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense in Q2, driven by the timing of our annual
compensation cycle.
The external environment remains complex. And as we have done throughout our history, we are focused on the
inputs that we can control to protect the customer experience who will work hard to remain the place customers'
trust for sharp prices, broad selection and convenience. We'll remain focused on driving a better customer
experience and we still believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our
shareholders.
With that, let's move on to your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions] . And the first
question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.

Ross Sandler Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. I think I'm going to leave the China questions to others and focus on AWS and kind of AI. So Andy, it
seems like you've been bringing on a lot more P5 GPU instances since February from what it looks like to kind of
support all these new AI workloads. So, how would you characterize in the first quarter and maybe here in the
second quarter, the kind of supply-demand imbalance that you talked about before around AI workloads.
And when do you think that AWS will be in a position to kind of capture enough AI revenue to drive acceleration.
Is that something that could happen this year? Or do you see that more like next year given your capacity
constraints? Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
Thanks, Ross. I would say that we've been bringing on a lot of P5s, which is a form of NVIDIA chip instances as
well as landing more and more Trainium2 instances as fast as we can. And I would tell you that our AI business
right now is a multi-billion dollar annual run rate business that's growing triple-digit percentages year-over-year.
And as fast as we actually put the capacity in, it's being consumed.
So, I think we could be driving – we could be helping more customers and driving more revenue for the business
if we had more capacity. We have a lot more Trainium2 instances and the next generation of NVIDIA's instances
landing in the coming months. I expect that there are other parts of the supply chain that are a little bit jammed up
as well motherboards and some other componentry.
But I do – and some of that is just because there is so much demand right now, but I do believe that the supply
chain issues and the capacity issues will continue to get better as the year proceeds.

your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric J. Sheridan Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Thank you so much for taking the question. Maybe I could ask a two-parter. First, in terms of strategy, Andy, how
do you think about positioning the company for the medium-term given all the levels of uncertainty out there about
how the global trade environment might shift in the coming months? What do you see as the key strategic
priorities that will allow the company to sort of be able to capitalize one way or another depending on various
elements of outcome? And how do you prioritize those investments in the months ahead?
And then with respect to the one quarter forward operating income guide, is there anything in there from a cost
side that we should be thinking about as purely aligned with those types of investments against the trade
landscape that might not repeat either later into this year or next year? Thanks so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
Thanks, Eric. It's hard to tell what's going to happen with tariffs right now. It's hard to tell where they're going to
settle and when they're going to settle. And so a lot of what we're thinking about short and medium-term, actually
turns out to be what we think about long-term too, which is how do we actually have the broadest possible
selection for customers at the lowest possible prices, and there's maybe never been a more important time in
recent memory than trying to keep prices low, which we are heads down pretty maniacally focused on and then
get things to people quickly and take care of customers.
And that is the heart of what we're doing. And you can see different initiatives that we've taken within those
priorities. We've done some forward buys of inventory where we're the first-party seller. Our third-party sellers
have pulled forward a number of items, so they have inventory here as well. And those are all – we're
encouraging that because we're trying to keep prices as low as possible for customers.
I think also when you have as broad selection as we have, we have much broader selection than other retailers, it
means that when you've got this continuity like we may potentially have, you're better able to help customers find
what they want, no matter what those trends are. And I mentioned in my opening comments about what
happened in the pandemic. And you can bet there are going to be things that we don't anticipate the customers
really value and want that are different. It could be a simple, by the way, is just favoring other brands that maybe
people didn't know about before, but where they have a more favorable price equation for customers.
And I think when you've also got – another thing that people forget is that when you've got 2 million-plus sellers,
they're not all going to take the same strategy if there ends up being higher tariffs. I mean there are going to be
plenty of sellers that decide to pass on those higher costs to end consumers, but they're going to – we have a lot
of sellers in lots of different countries and not all of them are going to pursue the same tack.
And so I think when you've got larger diversity like we have, we have a better chance of some of those sellers
deciding that they're going to capture share, and they're not going to pass on all or any of those tariffs to the
customers. And so I think customers are going to have a better chance of finding variety on selection and on
lower prices when they come here.

And the last thing I would say is that. We have been in a number of our businesses, but just I'd say over the last
six years or so, we have been diversifying where we produce things over a long period of time, we had, I would
say, a meaningfully higher concentration of where we produce components for AWS or devices in China than we
have now where we've diversified meaningfully over that time. And we just thought that was wise to do so.
And so, those are some of the ways that we're trying to make sure that we are protecting our customers over the
short, medium and long-term. But it turns out that most of those are the things that we focus most on, which is
really broad selection for Ultimate Choice, really low prices and very fast delivery.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Olsavsky A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Amazon.com, Inc.
Eric, I'll take your question on the guidance and especially on the operating income, I think that was your question
and the cost that might be in Q2. The thing I'd point to, again, is what I mentioned earlier, the stock-based comp
always steps up generally in Q2 versus Q1 and then resets the rate that carries through for the next four quarters.
You can look at historic trends to get an idea of that.
Secondly, we do have some additional Kuiper launch costs in Q2, you saw a launch happen this week. And a
reminder that we expense those launch costs until the point of commercialization, which the plan is to have that
later in this year.

Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please
proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Justin Post Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks. I'll go back to AWS. I know in the past you said revenues can be lumpy. Can you explain why that
might fluctuate up and down if it's beyond just capacity? And you see the competitors with some pretty good
growth rates, how do you think about the difference there? Obviously, your dollar growth is very good. But how do
you think about the difference there versus some of your competitors? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
Well, the first thing I would say is when we've historically said that revenue could be lumpy, this was – we've been
saying this well before what's happened with AI over the last couple years. And the reason for that is the sales
cycle for – particularly for enterprise. It's true for startups.
What you really want is you want to have the type of capabilities where start-ups want to primarily choose to run
on top of your platform, that's true. If look at the startup space, the vast majority of successful start-ups over the
last 10 to 15 years have run on top of AWS, and it's unpredictable when those start-ups are going to find product
market fit, and grow substantially. And it's hard for them to predict, it's even harder for us to predict.
And the same thing goes on the enterprise side, when you – but in a different way, when the sales cycle on the
enterprise side is that – you spent time trying to convince people that they should move from on-premises to the
cloud. And then that you have the right solution for them and then you pick a set of projects that you get
experience on and sometimes they use systems integrators, sometimes they use our own professional services,
sometimes they're doing it themselves.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 01-May-2025
Then there's the next tranche of migrations. And those migrations just take time. And some companies get
through them really quickly and some companies take longer to get through them. And what happens a lot of
times, too, is that they get excited and enthusiastic about the cost advantages and the speed of innovation
advantages they get moving to the cloud. And what was supposed to be a smaller next tranche turns into a much
larger next tranche.
And all of that has been true for a long time. It's very hard for us to predict because it really is contingent on what
enterprises – how they want to sequence it and resource it. Then you throw in AI which has its own very fast
growth cycle, particularly in certain types of use cases and those change. I mean I'll give you just some examples.
In the early days of – on the earliest days, I should say, of AI, what you've seen the most amount of has been
initiatives that get you productivity and cost avoidance. And we've seen that from so many of our AWS customers,
and we're doing a lot of it ourselves inside of Amazon using AI. And then you've also seen, I would say, large-
scale training with a lot of those are running on top of this as well. And as you know, Anthropic is running –
building the next few training models on top of our Trianium2 chip on AWS.
And then you've seen a couple of really big chatbots. And then what you've seen just in the last few months is
really kind of the explosion of coding agents. And if you just look at the growth of these coding agents the last few
months, these are companies like Cursor or Vercel, both of them run significantly on AWS.
But just look at the growth of that over the last few months, you just couldn't have predicted that sort of growth.
And so that's why it's lumpy. Sometimes you'll have very significant increases that you didn't predict and you
couldn't forecast. And then they'll grow at a good rate, but maybe not the same rate before the next big kind of
explosive growth.
And I would tell you that everything I just mentioned with interesting in AI is that we still haven't gotten to all the
other customer experiences that are going to be reinvented and all the other agents that are going to be built,
they're going to take the role of a lot of different functions today. And those are – they're – even though we have a
lot of combined inference in those areas, I would say we're not even at the second strike of the first batter in the
first inning. It is so early right now.
And then I would just say on the – how to think about relative growth rates, you always have to – the year-over-
year growth rate is really only a function of the percentage growth on the base with which you were operating
from. And we just have a very – a meaningfully larger base on the technology infrastructure side than others. And
so it's still – if you think about 17% year-over-year growth on a $117 billion revenue run rate, still pretty significant
growth. And as I said, I think we could be doing more if we had more capacity, and I expect that – the capacity to
ease in the coming months.

And then, Andy, your comments on Alexa about moving to more complex tasks. Can you talk about that more?
And just with Alexa, the products have been around for a long time and they've had different use cases. How do
you get users to shift their behavior more with Alexa? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Olsavsky A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Amazon.com, Inc.
Thanks, Doug. I'll take your first question. We had a strong quarter in AWS, as you mentioned, the margin
performance. Attributed to the strong growth that we're seeing, coupled with the impact of some continued
investment we're making in innovation and technology. I'll give you some examples.
So, we invest in software and process improvements and it ends up optimizing our server capacity, which helps
our infrastructure cost, been developing more efficient network using our low-cost custom networking gear. We're
working to maximize the power usage in our existing data centers, which both lowers our costs and also reclaims
power for other newer workloads.
And we're also seeing the impact of advancing custom silicon like Graviton, it provides lower cost not only for us
but also for our customers, a better price performance for them. But you're right, margins are impacted by a lot of
things, including our level of investment, competitive pricing, the mix of generative AI services as they're ramping
up will continue to evolve over the years to come.
So, we do have a lot of investment in infrastructure going on and planned for the second half of the year. So that
will – we'll start to see the impact of that. But we're happy with the performance of the team that's generating cost
savings. And it's a big focus as well as expanding the services and features for customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
On the Alexa question, we're really excited about Alexa+. And as I mentioned earlier, it is – she's much more
intelligent, much more capable and able to take real action. And to-date, most of the agents that have been out
there have really just been able to answer questions, which when it came out was very remarkable. But it's – I
think the future of agents is not just being intelligent but also being able to take action.
And that's actually – it requires a great model, but it also requires the ability to sync that model and to align that
model with being able to take the right action and execute and implement the right APIs or you can have very
suboptimal results. And so we've worked hard on that in Alexa+. We've been – we started rolling out over the last
several weeks. It's with now over 100,000 users with more rolling out in the coming months. And so far, the
response from our customers has been very, very positive. People are excited about it.
I think that it does a lot more things than what Alexa did before. And we're very fortunate in that we have over 0.5
billion devices out there in people's homes and offices and cars. So we have a lot of distribution already. But there
will be – to some degree, there will be a little bit of rewiring for people on what they can do because you get used
to patterns. I mean even the simple thing of not having to speak, Alexa speak anymore, we're all used to saying,
Alexa, before we want every action to happen.
And what you find is you really only have to do it the first time, and then really the conversation is ongoing where
you don't have to say Alexa anymore. And I've been lucky enough to have the alpha and the beta that I've been
playing with for several months, and it took me a little bit of time to realize I didn't have to keep saying Alexa, it's
very freeing when you don't have to do that.

And then I think it's just experience in trying things. So you can do things like you have guests coming over on a
Saturday night for dinner, and you can say, Alexa, please open the shades, put the lights on in the driveway and
on the porch, increase the temperature 5 degrees and pick music that would be great for dinner that's mellow.
And she just does it. And like when you have those types of experiences, it makes you want to do more of it.
When I was in New York, when we were announcing and I asked her what were the – we did the event way
downtown. I asked her what was great Italian restaurants or pizza restaurants, she gave me a list and she asked
me if you wanted me to make a reservation, I said yes. And she made the reservation, confirmed the time. Like
that, when you get into those types of routines, and you have those types of experience, they're very, very useful.
It is really like having a great personal system, which most people in the world don't have. And so I think that the
more and more that people get used to it, they will realize what she can do. And we're not going to be standing
still. We have a lot more functionality that we plan to add in the coming months, too.

Brian Nowak Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. Hey, Andy and Brian, so I have one for each of you guys. So Andy, you have
very complicated retail business with a lot of moving pieces to it. I imagine you have a lot of good data on what
you expect demand to be over the course of the year and the holidays and things.
As you kind of step back and analyze the business and the tariff uncertainty, can you just sort of walk us through
the one or two key areas operationally that you're most focused on, just to ensure that Prime Day, Thanksgiving
and the holidays goes smoothly as they possibly can.
And then secondly, Brian, just to kind of go back to Eric's earlier question, as we think about the 2Q EBIT guide,
are there any one-time costs or sort of tariff-related costs in there similar to that $1 billion that you called out in the
first quarter? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
Thanks, Brian. On the retail question, I would say that the areas that maybe we're most focused on to make sure
we are not just a great Prime Day, but Prime Day is just one event as you know and so is Peak, we're trying to be
great all year long for customers. The obvious ones are making sure that we help our sellers however we can,
because there's uncertainty for our sellers as well. So we're trying to make sure we provide a great experience.
We're trying to make sure that we have the right diversity of sellers and low prices for our customers.
I think all that – you have to also be very thoughtful around how much inventory you bring into your fulfillment
nodes at any one time, because you can imagine scenarios where either on your own when you're the first-party
seller or lots of third parties want to get as much inventory and as early as possible, trying to beat a deadline on
what may happen.
And if you end up with too much inventory in your fulfillment network, it really slows down your productivity and
your ability to get things out as quickly as you want for customers at the cost structure you want. So, being able to

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 01-May-2025
manage that thoughtfully. We've learned that over the years, and I think the team is doing a really good job of
balancing that right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Olsavsky A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Amazon.com, Inc.
And Brian, on your question about Q2, I guess I'd just reiterate what I had said earlier. We had stock-based comp
step up, which I think you can see the normal pattern for that, if you look at our history, we have additional Kuiper
expenses. Specifically, you asked about tariffs. We do have tariffs that we'll be paying on retail purchases based
on current tariffs. It's not large in Q2, we've done a lot of pre-buying of inventory in Q1, as I mentioned earlier.
But just generally, I think with the uncertainty we've added a bit to the range that we've given you. We generally
have a wide range. But just the general uncertainty that we're seeing and uncertainty of consumer demand and
everything else is causing us to increase the ranges a bit. So we'll see. We feel it's an informed view of Q2 right
now.
As Andy mentioned earlier, we saw actually some strength in April based on what could end up being some
prebuys of a number of things and advertising has been strong. So, we think there's a lot of positive trends but
certainly uncertainty right now for the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. And our final question will come from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed
with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brent Thill Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. On AWS, I'm curious if you could give us the backlog number. And Andy, to your point about many of
these core workloads still yet to come to cloud. Can you just update us on what you're seeing? Are you seeing
enterprise strength back? Are you seeing some confusion with AI clouding that transition and the timing of that?
Just give us a perspective on what you're seeing on that migration. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Fildes A
Vice President, Investor Relations, Amazon.com, Inc.
Hey. This is Dave. I'll just jump in on the backlog and turn it over to Andy. The backlog is $189 billion for Q1, that's
up about 20% year-over-year. And the weighted average remaining life on that is 4.1 years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
On the AWS question, Brent, around what we're seeing on the workloads, they haven't moved. What I would say
– the way I would characterize it is that we were on a very aggressive March that was methodical, but almost
metronomic before the pandemic of enterprises deciding that they wanted to move off their on-premises
infrastructure because of the speed of innovation, the developer productivity and the cost advantages of the
cloud.
And then when you got into the pandemic and the economy looked uncertain in the second half of that few years,
you had everybody trying to cost optimize and including us, by the way. And then as we started to emerge from
that trend, you saw generative AI explode and everybody wanted to try to find a way to have a workload or a set
of workloads there because people saw the potential, and it was also something that was generating a lot of
interest publicly.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 01-May-2025
And so what we've seen now over the last, call it 16 to 18 months or so, is that enterprises realize they need to do
both. And they want to do AI. They have all sorts of pilots at this point on AI, many of which will be successful,
others of which will not be successful. The ones that are successful will scale. But they also have a lot more
initiatives that they haven't – that they still haven't gotten to on the AI side, either because they're building that skill
set or they're picking the first set to get experience with or as they're waiting to see the cost of inference continue
to go down, which it will.
I mean, you will not get the expansiveness that we all know is coming in AI until we keep getting the cost of
inference down even though it's growing like crazy right now. But at the same time, I would say that we see an
increased resurgence and understanding for enterprises that they are dropping the low-hanging fruit if they don't
move their infrastructure to the cloud. They just – for all the reasons I mentioned earlier, so you're starting to see
those plans pick up again.
As I mentioned earlier, to one of the questions, you don't decide that you're going to transform your infrastructure
from on-premises to the cloud and see it happen in three months. That is typically a multiyear process, that some
companies do it fast, some companies do it slower, but they do it in tranches and they do it thoughtfully because
they can't afford for their application not to work as they're making that transition. And we're having meaningful
success in those conversations and in companies choosing to transform their infrastructure on top of AWS. And I
think you'll see that moving forward too.

Sridhar Ramaswamy
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Thanks, Jimmy, and hi, everyone. Thank you, all, for joining us today. We are off to a strong start to the year and I
couldn't be more proud of our team. Our core business is very strong, our product delivery remains in overdrive,
and our go-to-market engine continues to get stronger and stronger. We are in the zone and there's still an
enormous opportunity ahead.
At Snowflake, our mission is to empower every enterprise to achieve its full potential through data and AI. Our AI
data cloud helps customers get more value out of their data, innovate faster and remove friction from their
business operations. And as I have shared in the past few quarters, we are extending that value throughout the
data lifecycle. We remain disciplined in driving operational rigor across our business, gaining greater efficiency
even as we continue to invest aggressively in growth. We are building our strength in executing with urgency and
focus to capture the opportunities ahead and sustain durable momentum.

Q1 2026 Earnings Call 21-May-2025
Product revenue for Q1 was $997 million, up a strong 26% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of leap year,
product revenue grew 28% year-over-year. Our growth rate was stable quarter-over-quarter, showing no
deceleration. Remaining performance obligations totaled $6.7 billion with year-over-year growth of 34%. Our net
revenue retention was a very healthy 124%. As you can see, we have started the year with strong revenue
growth, and overall, very healthy results and we are increasing our growth expectations for the year.
As I've shared in the past few quarters, Snowflake is obsessed with creating product cohesion to make it easier
and easier for our customers to innovate faster and unlock more value from their data, from inception to insights.
Enterprise leaders like Canva and JPMorgan Chase bet their business on Snowflake because our platform is
easy to use, connected to enable fluid access to data wherever it sits, and trusted by companies of all sizes and
industries. And we are continuing to deliver on our vision of being the end-to-end technology provider for our
customers' data journey.
We have made important progress in delivering an accessible and flexible connectivity platform, both unstructured
as well as structured data. Snowflake Connectors, which leverages the technology from our acquisition of
Datavolo, enables customers with seamless connectivity and data integration with key platforms like Google
Drive, Workday, Slack, SharePoint and more to tap into critical data across the business.
Global pharmaceutical leader AstraZeneca, for example, can now analyze critical business data from systems like
SAP and Workday with ease. And customers like CloudZero leverage hundreds of powerful active data sharing
connections to securely exchange data with their partners and customers, driving value across our ecosystem. As
our data engineering business continues to show strength, we are helping our customers streamline and scale
their data pipeline with less and less friction and realize meaningful cost savings.
By consolidating data in Snowflake, Dentsu, a global marketing agency managing data for numerous Fortune 500
clients, reduced costs by 30% from simplified data architecture and reduced dependence on third-party tools.
They now use Snowflake Data Clean Room to help global brands securely combine customer data without
compromising privacy, enabling more personalized marketing campaigns while reducing risk.
On the analytics front, our world-class solutions continue to power mission-critical operations for our customers.
Global technology leader Siemens is collaborating with Snowflake to help manufacturers unlock new levels of
operational efficiency and scale. This enables customers to unify their information technology data such as supply
chain management and financial data with operational technology data like data from plant floor systems and
industrial equipment, leveraging Siemens' industrial edge and Snowflake's AI data cloud to gain better insight,
improve machine performance and optimize production processes across their business.
And as AI reshapes the enterprise, Snowflake is helping our customers lead the way with AI-ready data. Take
Samsung Ads, a leader in connected TV advertising, they leveraged Snowflake to connect advertisers with
millions of Samsung consumers while upholding strict privacy standards. By unifying their data on Snowflake,
Samsung Ads drives innovation in personalized customer experiences and accelerates the development of new
AI and ML forward advertising features, enabling advertisers to deliver more relevant content and enhance the
advertising experience.
We have an incredible product momentum, and we are continuing to innovate at lightning speed. In fact, this
quarter alone, we have brought over 125 product capabilities to market, a 100% increase over what we delivered
in Q1 of last year. We continue to see strong adoption of open data formats, especially truly open modern table
formats like Apache Iceberg. We recently announced that our customers can now leverage many of Snowflake's

core capabilities, including data sharing, security and performance optimization using Apache Iceberg, giving
them even more flexibility to manage and query data at scale.
When it comes to AI, pretty amazing to see our progress. A year ago, we were just getting started. Now, we have
over 5,200 accounts using our AI and machine learning on a weekly basis. Cortex AI has gone from a nascent
product area to a foundational pillar of enterprise AI strategies for customers around the world. It's accelerating
clinical research for healthcare companies with unified access to information and turning automotive customer
reviews into actionable insights to help them personalize their service.
As one of the world's largest food and beverage company, Kraft Heinz, is leveraging Snowflake Cortex to
empower its employees with innovative AI tools like [ph] HAT (00:08:51) or Kraft Heinz AI, their new internal AI
assistant. This initiative is designed to revolutionize internal workflows, enhance efficiency and drive AI adoption
across the organization, paving the way for future advancement in agentic AI.
Earlier this year, we launched Cortex Agents, which is now helping customers like Luminate Data, a leading
provider of entertainment insights, scale how they process and retrieve both unstructured and structured data.
That foundation is critical for developing, deploying and orchestrating the data agents driving their AI applications.
And we have further solidified our leadership by continuing to integrate cutting-edge models into Cortex, ensuring
day one availability of Meta's Llama 4 model. As I shared last quarter, we announced an expanded partnership
with Microsoft to host OpenAI models on Microsoft Azure [ph] region (00:09:50). We continue to provide our
customers with choice and flexibility to leverage the world's leading models for their enterprise AI applications.
We also launched the first of our AI-powered migration enhancements. Now, our customers can use Cortex to
test and review issues during their migration journey, making a time-intensive process much more efficient. And
this is just the start of what AI can do to make migrations go fast. All of these innovations are focused on driving
real value for our customers. We are making it easy to tap into structured data. We are making it easy to tap into
unstructured data as well. And we're helping our customers build a strong foundation to lead in the era of agentic
AI. We're continuing on this momentum and you'll see even more from us in just a few weeks.
During the first week of June, we'll be joined by tens of thousands of customers, partners and developers at
Snowflake Summit, a four-day event on our biggest yet, where we will reveal some truly exciting new capabilities
we are bringing to market to support our customers at every stage of their data journey.
As we innovate, we remain committed to scaling efficiently. Under the leadership of our new Chief Revenue
Officer, Mike Gannon, we have renewed focus and rigor across our go-to-market base. We're growing our go-to-
market operations while maintaining our close collaboration across engineering, product, marketing and sales to
bring products to market effectively. This ensures that we are able to deliver greater value to our existing
customers, while continuing to win new ones.
We're also expanding our addressable market. With the launch of Snowflake Public Sector, Inc., and our recent
Department of Defense Impact Level Provisional Authorization, we're now equipped to deliver mission-critical data
and AI solutions to the national security community, including the United States Department of Defense, its
military branches, and industry partners.
We also introduced new automotive solutions as part of our AI data cloud for manufacturing. These solutions
empower companies like CarMax and Nissan with advanced data and AI solutions to drive innovation and
efficiency and we are using our own AI internally to boost productivity.

Our go-to-market teams use our sales knowledge assistant powered by Cortex to access insights from our sales
knowledge base using natural language. With fast, intuitive, seamless apps like our Customer 360 app, they can
tap into rich insights on customer consumption front.
I'm proud of the discipline and efficiency we have built across the business. We've got a strong operational
rhythm, we're investing strategically for growth, and we are laying the groundwork for scale.
Mike, why don't you take us through more of the financial details?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Thank you, Sridhar. In Q1, product revenues grew 26% year-over-year to reach $997 million. As Sridhar
mentioned, we saw no deceleration in the business when adjusting for leap day. We continue to see meaningful
growth from new product offerings. Both Snowpark and Dynamic Tables outperformed expectations in Q1. Other
areas of strength included technology and retail sectors.
Q1 was a strong quarter for bookings. On our last call, I noted two large customers ran out of capacity in Q4 and
elected to delay their larger renewals. As expected, both of these accounts signed $100 million-plus contracts in
Q1. We view this variability in bookings as normal for our model. Our focus on new customer acquisitions is
yielding positive results. We added 451 net new customers in Q1, growing 19% year-over-year.
Turning to margins. In Q1, our non-GAAP product gross margin was margin was 75.7%. Our non-GAAP operating
margin was 9%, up 442 basis points year-over-year. We continue to focus on driving greater efficiency across the
entire company, while investing for growth.
Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 20%. As discussed on our last earnings call, we had several large
customers purchase as they consumed in Q4. This booking behavior impacts the seasonality of our free cash
flow. We expect this year to be more second half weighted.
In Q1, we used $491 million to repurchase 3.2 million shares at an average weighted price per share of $152.63.
We still have $1.5 billion remaining on our authorization through March 2027. We ended the quarter with $4.9
billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term, and long-term investments.
Now, moving to our outlook. We expect Q2 product revenue between $1.035 billion and $1.04 billion,
representing 25% year-over-year growth. We expect Q2 non-GAAP operating margin of 8%. For FY 2026, we are
increasing our revenue guidance to $4.325 billion, representing 25% year-over-year growth. As always, we
forecast based on observed customer behavior. We expect non-GAAP gross – product gross margin of margin of
approximately 75%, non-GAAP operating margin of 8%, non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin of 25%.
Finally, we will host our Investor Day on June 3 in San Francisco in conjunction with Snowflake Summit. If you are
interested in attending, please e-mail ir@snowflake.com. Before opening up the line for questions, I just wanted to
update you on my transition as mentioned on the Q4 conference call last quarter. We are in the process of
interviewing many great candidates, and we will make an announcement in the future when we have more firm
details to share.
With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is
now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjit K. Singh Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thank you. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Congrats on an outstanding Q1. Sridhar, I want to talk about
some of the trend lines of the business, particularly around consumption as it progressed through the quarter.
How was consumption sort of exiting the quarter and through the month of May? That's my first question, then I
have a follow-up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
As you know, we don't comment on consumption within a quarter. Overall, Q1 consumption was very strong
coming out of the holiday period, and you see that in our results. Of course, Q1 had one less day compared to Q1
last year. But overall, we feel very good about where consumption is.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
And I would say, Sanjit, we just gave guidance for the quarter and that's based upon the customer behaviors
we're seeing through today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjit K. Singh Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yes, and that Q2 guide was very strong, so I think there's a lot to take away from there. And then, Sridhar, on the
product front, you mentioned about the adoption of Cortex continuing to build. I was wondering to see what are
sort of the monetization trends associated with Cortex. And to what extent are customers making commitments
associated with Cortex in mind and driving that into their sort of overall consumption Snowflake?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
I would split that into a few parts, Sanjit. One is that it is very, very clear that people invest in Snowflake. People
invest in data systems, not just for what they used to be able to do before, which is things like analytics and
machine learning, but increasingly for what they will be able to do today and in the future. And part of what I tell
our customers is that by working with us, by bringing data into Snowflake, they are making their data, they are
making their processes AI-ready as it were.
And we have taken a very measured approach to how we have had our customers use AI. As you know, we don't
sell AI separately. It's not a SKU. Customers are not signing up for contracts on AI, so it's on their existing spend.
We have focused a lot on use cases that deliver value today. I've talked about some of these examples. It's
everything from being able to create chatbots on documents like we have created for our own internal
enablement, or Siemens has created for all of the PDF manuals of their 150,000 devices to putting business data
directly into the hands of end users without needing analyst or BI tools in the mix, beginning to see compound
systems get adopted, where you bring in more than one data source that can disambiguate between the kinds of

Q1 2026 Earnings Call 21-May-2025
questions that the user has, or multi-step flows where you take data from one source and use that to answer
questions or do follow-ups from others.
So it's very graduated from that perspective. But the overall point that I want to make is that every user of data,
every CDO, including our own, now realizes that their data strategy, especially one with Snowflake, is a direct
unlock for whatever they're going to do with AI, both today and several years down the road. So in that sense, I
think the road maps are merging. It's not do AI separately on the side. It is more of invest in Snowflake to get your
data house in gear and realize value from AI as you go along.

Operator: Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your
line is now open.

Kirk Materne Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Yes. Thanks very much and congrats on a nice start to the year. Sridhar, I was wondering if you could just dive in
a little bit on the comment around Snowpark and Dynamic Tables outperforming. I was just curious, and I'm sure
it's a bit of both, how much is just the product maturation and sort of the readiness for customers to take those on
versus some of the things you guys have got done on the go-to-market side over the last year in terms of
enablement and – sales enablement with those products? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Richards A
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good question. It's clearly going – clearly, it's going to be – it's both. You need great products that drive utilities.
And in addition to those features that you mentioned, Snowpark and Dynamic Tables, I would say that our
investments in things like Iceberg also vastly increased the scope of the kinds of things that our customers can do
with the data. And similarly, Snowflake Connectors is then going to make more and more data available for these
data engineering tools as well as analytics. And this is why Christian and I stress the end-to-end data life cycle a
lot. And so our motto often is we want to be there from ingestion to insight when it comes to data.
Having said that, we have hired, in addition to Mike, amazing leaders in sales that are in charge of driving these
more specialized motions. Yes, not everybody in the Snowflake sales team is going to become an expert on our
AI products or the latest advancements in Snowflake Connectors out of the box. So we have a specialist motion
that is very targeted, that identifies the highest-value use cases that our customers have, pioneers
implementations for them so that they can be used as a template to be repeated in other places and increasingly
with our GSI partners. And so you need to be able to do both. You need great products that create value, but then
a go-to-market team that can initiate the value and do the hard work of both establishing the flagship customers
and then driving sales across the sales teams.

Operator: Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your
line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raimo Lenschow Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey. Perfect. Sridhar, if you – looking at Snowpark and the adoption there, how do you see this playing out at the
moment and maybe more in the future in terms of like going wall to wall with one vendor versus having different
pockets of data that are sitting in your system versus kind of other systems? How do you – what are you seeing
there at the moment and how do you think that will evolve?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
First of all, I think one of the things that is making us successful, Snowflake as a company, is our
acknowledgment and willingness to work with customers that have complex data ecosystems. It's always going to
be just actually true that there are on-prem legacy systems in most large customers, or that there are large data
estates that are sitting in cloud storage.
But I think what is unique about this moment is that customers are a little unhappy about needing to switch
together many different tools in order to achieve even relatively simple things. If you think about it, if you wanted –
if you and your company wanted to build a chatbot on a corpus sitting in SharePoint, it's rather painful if you have
to use four different tools in order to produce that. And at the end of it, you won't even have your governance right
because you have to go reinvent it. Part of what we want to be able to do for cases like that is have Snowflake
Connectors point to the SharePoint repository. And if there is any augmentation or transformation of the data that
is needed, you get that done, for example, with Snowpark, and then you create an index with Cortex Search and
hook it up to a chatbot.
I think we will continue to see specialist players that exist, and we partner with them and we value our
partnerships with them. But there are also a number of use cases that are ripe for effectively like ease of use and
consolidation. And that's the thing that we are leaning in.
Anything to add, Christian?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Kleinerman A
Executive Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc.
Maybe super quickly, the other investment that we made is around Iceberg, which also creates an opportunity for
customers to have an open architecture and be able to mix and match technologies as they see fit.

Raimo Lenschow Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yes. Okay, perfect. And then one quick one for Mike. Obviously, it was very good opportunistic on the share
buyback side this quarter. How do you think about that traction there for the rest of the year now that shares are
starting to look better? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
We will continue to evaluate share buyback on a quarterly basis, and we have no plans right now. We've been
more opportunistic in terms of the buyback, but we do fully anticipate between now and 2027, we will utilize that.

Karl E. Keirstead Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, great. Thanks. Mike, in the comments from you and Sridhar, there was really no mention of macro per se
and no evidence in the numbers that you guys really saw much pressure. You certainly did back in 2022, 2023.
And I'm just curious, Mike, how you would draw a contrast. Is it that a lot of the post-COVID optimization efforts
are now largely behind you, Snowflake just in a better place in terms of the product portfolio? Or maybe just the
degree of macro pressure, the wobbliness we've all seen in the last couple of months is just not as severe as you
had to deal with in that post-COVID downturn? Some contrast might be helpful. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
I would say coming out of COVID, I think it was very different. In that environment, we had a lot of digitally-native
well-funded start-ups that were spending crazy and weren't really focused on costs as much. Our customer base
has really evolved into some of the largest companies in the world that are much more mature, that are much
more cost-focused. And I am not seeing any big optimizations planned within our customers like what we saw
coming out of COVID with those.
But I will remind you, our customers are constantly optimizing. That may be a little bit, but they're always looking
to do things more efficiently and that will continue. I would say in terms of the macro right now, we really have not
seen the impact of anything with the current – all the news on tariffs and other things today. I think if we would
have seen that, we would have saw it in the number of new customers. We had a great new customer add and
we had great additions to RPO with this confidence, and that shows the confidence our customers have on
making big bets with Snowflake.

...I'll add to what Mike said is that this is something that our sales team practices as well, which is to make sure
that whenever a use case gets implemented, that they actually take the trouble to tidy things up and make sure
that things are optimized because our sales team has learned, thanks to 2022 and 2023, that inefficient spend
from customers inevitably leads to a contraction later anyway. And we are better off making sure that it is always
efficient spend.

Mark R. Murphy Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yes. Congrats on the great execution, Mike. Even if we were expecting a strong start to the year in terms of the
hiring in sales and marketing, I don't think we would have pictured this many hires. It's a very big number. Can
you speak to that dynamic and just whether – are you hiring into a pipeline that is strengthening around Cortex or
Snowpark or some other opportunity that you see opening up?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
What I would say, Mark, is just our confidence we have in the business, and it's not just AI, it's everything that
we're seeing in Snowflake. And as you know, Q1 is always our biggest hiring from a sales and marketing
perspective because we try to get those people on board at the beginning of the year to deal – so they can be
part of our sales kickoff and all of our sales and enablement that we do with the employees in the beginning of the
year with all the new features and stuff.
So I wouldn't read that much other than the confidence we see in our business. But as you know and we talked
about, we're still really looking for operational excellence, and we are constantly looking at productivity of people
and we will add people and we will stop adding if we don't see productivity pay off with those people.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark R. Murphy Q

Okay, understood. And then Sridhar, can you speak to the federal government opportunity because you had
touched on it in your comments? Do you think that DOGE is going to run through this initial process of eliminating
wasteful spend and then maybe pivot back toward issuing some new RFPs? And then you've got the right
certifications. I'm just curious if you think some agencies might be moving off-legacy on-prem data warehouses
and maybe moving some of that onto Snowflake a little later in the year?

Q1 2026 Earnings Call 21-May-2025
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
This is an active topic of conversation with many departments in the government. I was in D.C. a few weeks ago,
met with a number of folks, and there is both an increasing awareness of what Snowflake can do. The fact that we
have very low operational overhead figures prominently. And there's also a little bit of an active change where
they're very much focused on how do they make sure that our data infrastructure is run efficiently.
There's also a desire for things like cross-department sharing of data because that just leads to more efficiency.
You'll have more to say on this topic. And Mike, our new CFO, is certainly actively looking at this area as well. We
are optimistic and hopefully, we'll have more to say about this in the coming quarters.

Your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kash Rangan Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hi, thank you very much. It's really heartening to see the positive shift in the narrative, strategic positioning and
the execution and handling of everything, so good to see that. Two things to – regardless, I mean, although you're
approaching $4 billion run rate and growing 26%, 27%, is remarkable. If I could take the liberty of poking at the
NRR, so 124% is good. Not many companies even reach that number at your scale, if they reach your scale. But
you have had 135 new products launched in the most recent quarter, and Scarpelli will be quick to point out that
the NRR metric is more of a 24-month trailing metric, which I completely appreciate.
But why wouldn't and why shouldn't NRR be better, given the tail effect of new product introduction, the landing
customers at record pace? And to Mike's point, the yield of enterprise customers is higher quality. You've got AI
which didn't exist in 2022. Volatility, which should play to your advantage. So, anything on that front? And
anything that your new CRO could do to land that number as good as it is, even higher? And I have a very quick
follow-up question. Thank you so much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
What I would say on that is a number of our newer customers that are not in that cohort are contributing to our
growth beyond what the NRR is. And there was one of our large customers that grew so much last year. In this
year, they're still doing very well but they didn't grow as much this year. And that's really the dynamics. It's those
newer customers coupled with that. But once again, over time, NRR and revenue growth rate will converge as we
become a more mature company.

enable AI, agentic architecture is a thing that's not lost on the big guys. Where does that lead Snowflake? And
what is going to be the one or two or three things that the Snowflake's platform would do better, so you can build
your vision towards being a $10-plus billion revenue company? That's it for me. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Just like – hyperscalers are formidable. They are amazing both from an engineering execution and business
perspective, but they also work with Anthropic and OpenAI because they are the best – among the best model
makers in the world. Similarly, we are very uniquely positioned in terms of being the excellent data platform that
there is. And we've also learned how cooperating really leads to a better outcome, whether it is with AWS, which
is our biggest partner, or more and more with Azure. There are many customers that Azure plus Snowflake is just
a better outcome for everybody that is involved.
And we have deep partnerships between the team. I think it was six, seven months ago that we announced, for
example, that from Snowflake, you could read tables that are in OneLake, and we are also actively talking to them
about OneLake being the data layer for Snowflake that's at the bottom. We also collaborate with them at the top,
where we have things like Cortex Analyst and Cortex Agents be available as components in Office Copilot, for
example.
So we very much take this approach of finding customers, for example, who are on a modernization routine, or
who want to get value, AI value from data and figure out how we can work together. Yes, there is competition, but
I think there are more cases than not where we are very, very effectively working together, and it's on the uptick,
especially with Azure.

I'm actually even more pleased with how we've been able to seize the AI opportunity. I've spoken to you folks
previously about how we created what we then called the AI ninjas, which were a group of solution engineers that
were deeply versed with our AI products that could be very close to our sales teams from around the globe and
just the excitement that our sales team feels about AI, but more importantly, their ability to drive AI use cases at
scale to both pitch the vision, but also run POCs for them, win them and get them into production. That's been a
pretty remarkable transformation for us. And we are now in the process of making this kind of specialized
knowledge available to more and more of the sales team. I think it is this combination of specialist teams that
know more about a sophisticated area like AI, again, doing the initial work but having more of the team participate

in it. That's been hugely positive for us. And we apply similar techniques in data engineering, though with data
engineering, I would say it's much closer to the knowledge and skill set of more of our sellers. In some sense, it's
more natural to them. But AI is doing exceptionally well as well. And we have assembled a team of both specialist
sellers in AI, but also specialist technical experts that are driving change across the whole sales organization.
That, combined with an increasing understanding of what it takes to drive great use cases in general, not just in AI
and data engineering but also across other areas like analytics, really heralds a new era of data-driven, go-to-
market, which I'm very, very happy about.

Brad Zelnick Q

Great. Thanks so much and congrats on a good start to the year. Sridhar, as we think – I just want to follow-up on
Kirk's question. As we think about Snowpark adoption from here, beyond capturing maybe the Spark jobs where
data was moving off platform, can you talk about success that you're seeing in penetrating more of the media or
data science use cases and any anecdotal evidence that you're winning over the data science crowd and maybe
the impact that Notebooks are having would be great? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yes. I'll start the answer. Christian can add on. Our Notebooks are doing very well. Several thousand customers
are actively using them. And there is increasing ability, for example, to train larger and larger machine learning
models. As you folks know, like the world has made enormous amount of progress on the basis of machine
learning, even though AI is all the hotness these days. But when it comes to many interesting use cases, for
example, next best action prediction, which the likes of Hilton do, are how to route guests to the next ride, which
customers like Disney do. These are all things that we have gained increasing market share around.
Notebooks continue to expand. We continue to add product capabilities for training bigger, better, faster models
on machines running in container services. These tend to be more technical in terms of the kind of people that are
involved, the implementations that happen, but definitely appealing to the developers, the data scientists. That
sort of product-led motion is something that is going on pretty well. Christian?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Kleinerman A
Executive Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. One quick addition is Snowpark is a collection of libraries and capabilities that help customers do a variety
of activities. We see lots of people leveraging it for unstructured data processing, which is core part of what we're
doing. As Sridhar said, we're making more unstructured data available to customers. So, Snowpark for extracting
structure and signal and doing traditional ML on unstructured data is a common use case we're seeing.

I would just say, as I said, our guidance is based upon the observed behavior we see within our customers,
coupled with we spend a lot of time than we have for the last five quarters now, and really identifying new
workloads going to production. And we have a pretty good visibility of those, and we're very close with our
customers and we know what we're doing. Migrations are moving nicely. We announced we're – we've made
SnowConvert available to all of our customers and partners, and we're seeing an uptick in the amount of usage
around that, and that's what gives us the confidence in the guidance that we gave.

Q
This is [indiscernible] (00:43:25) on for Brent Thill. Thanks for taking the question. With features like Cortex
Analyst and Cortex Agents that can help users to write more efficient queries, like are you seeing more query
optimization as Cortex AI adoption picks up? And what's been the net impact on usage so far in terms of net new
queries and query optimizations? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
With things like Cortex Analyst, if anything, the end users are a step removed from writing SQL queries, the user
semantic model to aid in figuring out the intent of the user query and then auto-generate the SQL promise.
Certainly, we've made available Copilot-like features, both for what we call worksheets, which is where people
write SQL or Python, but also inside Notebooks.
To be honest with you, I think there is a huge amount of innovation that is coming there, some of which we will
show at Summit. The bar for people being able to write code now are modern dollar per platforms like Cursor,
which – and get a Copilot and others, which can massively increase productivity in terms of the volume of queries
that can be written, as well as the amount of work that can be done.
While we don't have concrete measurements of this leads to X percent more query, we are very happy about
being able to help our customers write queries faster or write code faster and be able to debug it faster as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Kleinerman A
Executive Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. We're saying in these calls and other forums that our preference, our goal is to make sure that customers
are optimized all the time. I think none of us like to go and spend money and then optimize and go up and down.
So, we put a lot of effort in technology. Some of the Cortex examples that you have are part of that. But query
insights, cost insights, governance insights all over this product, how we help customers be in a better optimized
state all along.

line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick Colville Q
Analyst, Scotiabank
Oh hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. I guess my one is for Sridhar. Last year, the Arctic LLM was
launched. My question is how important are first-party foundation models to Snowflake's strategy as of today or is
there like a slight pivot more to kind of partnering with third-party foundation models?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
I've said this before. I think the business of training a truly large foundation model has gotten to be a very
expensive proposition. We have an amazing team of AI researchers, but they tend to focus more on things like
post-training. We have published blogs, for example, about how we can be much more efficient, like much more
correct at generating SQL queries by using post-training techniques. This makes Cortex Analyst better.
I think at least for now, the era of us training, let's call it, frontier foundation model is now something that we are
actively looking at. But the research team continues to do amazing work, as I said, in post-training, but also in
areas like inference optimization, which has a huge impact on latency, it has a huge impact on margins in AI. So,
we continue to have a robust presence in the area, but we work with partners. Meta is a big partner. We were a
day one launch partner for the Llama 4 model that came out. We actively collaborate with Anthropic, with OpenAI,
Mistral, [ph] BReka (00:47:44), lots of model providers.
The one fun thing I'll add is that in the area of embedding models, these are small unsung heroes, but they are
the models that essentially produce fingerprints of documents that you want to index for chatbots, for example.
They have world-class embedding models that we have open source. We have to be opportunistic about where
we can create value because we simply can't afford to spend the billions of dollars that it takes to be a frontier
research lab today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick Colville Q
Analyst, Scotiabank
Crystal clear. Thank you, Sridhar. And can I just squeeze in a follow-on for Mike? I mean, the bottom line is
clearly less of a focus when you're growing the top line, 26%, with the possibility to reaccelerate in the back half of
the fiscal year. But one key operating margin was strong. Nonetheless, the fiscal year op margin was left
unchanged as was the fiscal year free cash flow margin target. So, I guess what were the puts and takes there as
to why leave those targets unchanged?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Well, what I would say is in Q2 is when we have our big user event, and that's a very expensive event, Summit,
that we operate, and that typically has an impact on our operating margin in Q2, and that's factored in. And we'll
just continue to revise our forecast for the year on a quarterly basis going forward.

I actually think that we are being pretty thoughtful when it comes to expanding our operating margin. It was 4% in
Q1 last year. It's 9% Q1 this year. And this is part of the benefit of practicing what we preach around AI. We
spend a lot of time figuring out how engineers can be more productive with AI, how we can get more work done.
Similarly in the sales team, we launched to automate many of the tasks that our sales team doesn't like to do
anyway so that they can be more productive in front of sellers. We feel that we are in quite a bit of a Goldilocks
moment where we can continue to grow revenue very strongly while continuing to be very efficient when it comes

Alex Zukin Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a high-level one first for you, Sridhar or Mike. I guess,
again, it seems like what we're hearing from you is the demand environment is really unchanged, untouched by all
the macro headlines. You're seeing new product adoption ahead of expectations. So maybe just the first one, are
you seeing a change? Like is this being driven by any kind of identifiable AI tailwinds, you're seeing a change with
how customers are either investing in their AI stack with Snowflake or building agents? Specifically, they're
building more on data rather than just focusing on the models. Like maybe just help us understand and
conceptualize the AI tailwind or you're placed within these AI budgets that a lot of your large customers clearly are
making those bets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
As I was saying earlier, I think more and more people have internalized that to be good at AI, your data needs to
be in here. And what we have done on our side is to create a product, whether it's a semantic model that sits very
close to the data, usable by anyone, mind you, not just by Snowflake, but also products like Cortex Analyst that
can actually unlock the value of that data, both by immediate use, like a chatbot on a specific data set, but much
more importantly, for use in an agentic workflow. So, more and more of our conversations can now focus on what
creates value from a business perspective.
So AI for Snowflake, rather than being this additional thing that we do, in some ways, becomes the natural end
state for what investing well in data means. And of course, we are using AI ourselves both within the company,
but also in different aspects of the product. We talked about code generation and Notebooks being accelerated by
cursor-like experiences.
On the other hand, we make SnowConvert, our conversion tool, free so that anyone could use them. And we're
bringing agentic workflows into SnowConvert so that people can do things like testing with synthetic data far
sooner than what they would have done in a traditional waterfall-style migration. I'd say it's a combination of all of
these trends that are driving Snowflake forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alex Zukin Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Excellent. And maybe just as a follow-up, maybe Sridhar, for you or for Christian, there's been a lot of excitement
that we've sensed around Gen2 and particularly the performance improvements that your customers are seeing. I
guess maybe just touch on, is this potentially leading to unlocking new use cases around the capabilities

introduced or how should we think about the potential for some of these new functions as they percolate in the
platform?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Kleinerman A
Executive Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. The – Christian here. The best way to think about Gen2 is our latest and greatest compute environment.
What we've done is we've combined the latest hardware instances that we can get from the cloud providers,
which are often faster but also more expensive with a good number of software optimizations and improvements
that we have, and at the end of the day, is part of our eternal ongoing promise to customers to always deliver the
best price performance of the market. Some of the benchmarks that we have on Gen2 are completely
phenomenal relative both to Snowflake, say, a year ago, but also to many of the competitive patterns are there.
So think of it as price performance, which continue to correlate with time to insight and time to value, and it's a
material step forward.

Joel P. Fishbein Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Thanks for taking the question. Mike, you mentioned earlier on the call you had the strongest new logo quarter,
which was fantastic. Just a question around that. Are you seeing – is this a result of better, stronger execution and
strategic focus or are you seeing a more favorable win rate in competitive environment? And just as a follow-up,
too, to that is, of those two $100 million deals, can you just tell us which verticals they were in? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
So on the $100 million deals, they were both in the financial services vertical. And what I would say on the
number of new customers, this is not a result of something we put in place this quarter. We started last year with
really breaking out an acquisition team that is just focused on new logos, and we're seeing the benefits of the
groundwork that we put in place last year. And we're pleased with the results. I think we have a very good leader
there, and we're replicating what we're doing in North America and EMEA as well, too. So, we're pleased with the
number of new logos that we've added, and it's a big focus of ours.

Q1 2026 Earnings Call 21-May-2025
Great. Thanks very much. Last quarter, Mike, you talked about some changes to the sales force comp plan as
related to bookings and commits, not just consumption. Maybe an update on how that's tracking and if that had
any impact on the strong bookings in the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. Obviously, I think it helped, but the real strong bookings for those two big deals that we knew were going to
come in, I would say, I think in general, salespeople are happy with having a bookings component, but still, the
principal driver is consumption revenue. And as a reminder, we paid on bookings [ph] a step (00:56:26) last year.
So, it's not like we weren't doing it last year. We just are giving them a quote in how – for bookings as well, too.
And I think it's going to take some time to see the real roots of that change, whether that worked or not, but I'm
pleased for Q1. I think we had a very solid Q1 and it definitely helped.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Reback Q
Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
That's great. And then just a quick one, getting into the weeds a little bit, CapEx was up a bunch to a fairly high
number. Was there one-time items or is this the new level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
No. The CapEx was really associated with our new headquarters in San Mateo. As I spoke about previously, we
signed a new lease in our Menlo Park office and there's a fair bit of CapEx that went into that, as well as in
Bellevue. We talked about – I talked about that before, too. That really – that just opened this week, that office,
and there was a fair bit of CapEx that went into that as well, too. I'm not expecting any major office buildouts the
next couple years actually now.

Tyler Radke Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks for taking the question here. Mike, you talked about some strength in technology customers in the
quarter. I was wondering if you could double-click on that. And what are you seeing specifically among kind of
larger AI-native customers in terms of their consumption?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
It's good, but as I called it before, we have a number of AI companies, and they're still less than 1% of our
[indiscernible] (00:58:07).

Q1 2026 Earnings Call 21-May-2025
Okay. Great. And the follow-up question I had was for Sridhar. We recently saw Databricks acquire Neon, which
was a company that Snowflake Ventures had invested in. And I'm just curious if we get an update on your
strategy around Unistore and just sort of your view on the positioning over some of these serverless Postgres
databases that are out there in the market.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
We've believed in transactional systems for a while. This is why we got to work on Unistore, what, five years ago.
Unistore, the product, is doing very well. Postgres as a standard is nothing to be stopped at and it's adopted
widely. But we are pretty happy with what we have invested in terms of transactional stores so far, and we will
continue to invest in the area because it's a very natural addition to what we do.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tyler Radke Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you for your question. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So, I'll pass the
call back to Sridhar for any closing remarks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Thank you. In closing, Snowflake is at the center of today's enterprise AI evolution. Our focus on making
Snowflake easy to use, connected to enable fluid access to data wherever it sits, and trusted for enterprise-grade
performance is what makes us differentiated beloved by our customers. And we are committed to supporting
them through their end-to-end data journey, from inception to insights. Our product revenue growth and strong
outlook for FY 2026 demonstrates our continued ability to execute at scale. Our pace of innovation, coupled with
our ability to bring products to market quickly, is driving high growth, and we are committed to maintaining that
momentum. We believe Snowflake's long-term profile is one that showcases durable, high growth and continued
margin expansion. It's an exciting time for our company, and I look forward to sharing more of our progress in the
quarters ahead. Thank you, all, for joining us.

GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's
third quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results.
All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless
otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for
assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.
Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our
prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available.
Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission,

During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other
statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are
subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's
earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our
Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not
undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Satya Nadella
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Jonathan. It was a record quarter, driven by continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed
$42 billion in revenue, up 22% in constant currency. Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to
expand output, reduce costs and accelerate growth.
Now, I'll highlight examples starting with infrastructure. We continue to expand our data center capacity. This
quarter alone, we opened DCs in 10 countries across four continents. Model capabilities are doubling in
performance every six months, thanks to multiple compounding scaling laws. We continue to optimize and drive
efficiencies across every layer, from DC design to hardware and silicon to system software to model optimization,
all towards lowering costs and increasing performance. You see this in our supply chain where we have reduced
dock-to-lead times for new GPUs by nearly 20% across our blended fleet where we have increased AI
performance by nearly 30% ISO power and our cost per token, which has more than halved.
When it comes to cloud migrations, we saw accelerating demand with customers in every industry, from
Abercrombie & Fitch, to Coca-Cola and ServiceNow expanding their footprints on Azure. And we remain the cloud
of choice for customers' mission-critical VMware, SAP and Oracle workloads with more regional availability than
any other hyperscaler.
We're also excited about the next frontier in cloud systems with quantum. In addition to putting our quantum stack
on machines from our partners, we're also making real progress on a path to a utility scale quantum computer
with the introduction of Majorana 1.
When it comes to data and analytics, we have deeply integrated our AI platform with our data stack. PostgreSQL
usage accelerated for the third consecutive quarter, and it is now used by nearly 60% of the Fortune 500,
including companies like BMW and BNY Mellon. Cosmos DB revenue growth also accelerated again this quarter

and remains the go-to database for globally distributed NoSQL workloads at any scale. It is used by customers in
every industry like CarMax, Docusign, NTT Data and OpenAI.
This quarter, we also saw analytics consumption accelerate. Microsoft Fabric has more than 21,000 paid
customers, up 80% year-over-year. Fabric brings together data workloads like data warehousing, data science,
real-time intelligence, along with Power BI into one end-to-end solution. Real-time intelligence is now the fastest-
growing workload in Fabric with 40% of customers already using it in just five months since becoming generally
available. All up, more than 50% of Fabric customers like Amorepacific, Louisiana state government and
Petrobras use three or more workloads. And the amount of data in our multi-cloud data lake, OneLake, has grown
more than 6x over the past year.
Now on to AI platform and tools. Foundry is the agent in AI app factory. It's now used by developers at over
70,000 enterprises and digital natives from Atomicwork to Epic, Fujitsu and Gainsight to H&R Block and LG
Electronics to design, customize, and manage their AI apps and agents. We processed over 100 trillion tokens
this quarter, up 5x year-over-year, including a record 50 trillion tokens last month alone. And four months in, over
10,000 organizations have used our new agent service to build, deploy and scale their agents.
This quarter, we also made a new suite of fine-tuning tools available to customers with industry-leading reliability,
and we brought the latest models from OpenAI, along with new models from Cohere, DeepSeek, Meta, Mistral,
Stability to Foundry. And we've expanded our five family of SLMs with new multimodal and mini models. All up,
Phi has been downloaded 38 million times. And our research teams are taking it one step further with BitNet
b1.58, a billion parameter, large language model that can run on just CPUs coming to the Foundry.
Now on to developer tools. We're evolving GitHub Copilot from paired to peer programmer. With agent mode in
VS Code, Copilot can now iterate on code, recognize errors and fix them automatically. This adds to other copilot
agents like Autofix, which helps developers remediate vulnerabilities as well as code review agent, which has
already reviewed over 8 million pull requests.
And we are previewing a first-of-its-kind SWE agent capable of asynchronously executing developer tasks. All up,
we now have over 15 million GitHub Copilot users, up over 4x year-over-year, and both digital natives like Twilio
and enterprises like Cisco, HPE, Skyscanner and Target continue to choose GitHub Copilot to equip their
developers with AI throughout the entire dev life cycle.
With Visual Studio and VS Code, we have the world's most popular editor with over 50 million monthly active
users. And with Power Platform, we have the leading low-code platform for AI makers, too. We now have 56
million monthly active Power Platform users, up 27% year-over-year, who increasingly use our AI features to build
apps and automate processes.
Now on to future of work. Microsoft 365 Copilot is built to facilitate human agent collaboration. Hundreds of
thousands of customers across geographies and industries now use Copilot, up 3x year-over-year. Our overall
deal size continues to grow. In this quarter, we saw a record number of customers returning to buy more seats.
And we're going further. Just last week, we announced a major update, bringing together agents, notebooks,
search and create into a new scaffolding for work. Our new researcher and analyst, deep reasoning agents
analyze vast amounts of web and enterprise data to deliver highly skilled expertise on demand directly within
Copilot.

Beyond horizontal knowledge work, we are introducing agents for every role and business process. Our sales
agent turns contacts into qualified leads and with sales chat, reps can quickly get up to speed on new accounts,
and our customer service agent is deflecting customer inquiries and helping service reps resolve issues faster.
With Copilot Studio, customers can extend Copilot and build their own agents with no-code/low-code. More than
230,000 organizations, including 90% of the Fortune 500 have already used Copilot Studio.
With deep reasoning and agent flows in Copilot Studio, customers can build agents that perform more complex
tasks and also handle deterministic scenarios like document processing and financial approvals. And they can
now build computer use agents that take action on the UI across desktop and web apps. And with just a click,
they can turn any SharePoint site into an agent, too. This quarter alone, customers created over 1 million custom
agents across SharePoint and Copilot Studio, up 130% quarter-over-quarter.
When it comes to business applications, Dynamics 365 again took share as companies like Avaya, Brunswick,
Softcat, switch to Dynamics from legacy providers. Verizon, for example, chose Dynamics 365 Sales to improve
the efficiency of its sellers. In healthcare, Dragon Copilot is off to a fast start. Last quarter alone, we helped
document nearly 9.5 million physician-patient encounters at providers like City of Hope, Ottawa Hospital, Tufts
Medicine and Wellstar, up over 50% quarter-over-quarter.
In manufacturing, we introduced factory operations and safety agents at HANNOVER MESSE, and leading
partners like Autodesk, PTC and Siemens have all built their own industrial AI solutions on our stack. And in retail,
we have introduced agents to help customers, like Bath & Body Works, build more personalized shopping
experience and improve store operations.
When it comes to Windows, Copilot+ PCs are faster and have better battery life than any other device in their
category. We also continue to win new customers with best-in-class AI capabilities. We offer a growing number of
AI apps from partners like Adobe, Canva and Zoom. Just last week, we rolled out exclusive AI experiences like
Recall, Click to Do and Windows Search to all Copilot+ PCs. And we continue to see increased commercial
traction as we approach end of support for Windows 10. Windows 11 commercial deployments increased nearly
75% year-over-year.
Now on to security. Security is our top priority, and we have made significant progress against the engineering
objectives we outlined 1.5 years ago as part of our Secure Future Initiative. We are now applying these learnings
to deliver new innovation across our platform.
Last month, along with our partners, we introduced Security Copilot agents to help Defenders autonomously
handle high-volume security and IT tasks informed by 84 trillion daily threat signals. We also added new
capabilities to Defender, Entra and Purview to help organizations secure and govern their AI deployments. All up,
we now have 1.4 million security customers, over 900,000, including EY Global, ManpowerGroup, TriNet,
Regions Bank have four or more workloads, up 21% year-over-year. And in identity, Entra now has more than
900 million monthly active users.
Now on to our Consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn. Over 1 billion professionals use LinkedIn to connect,
learn, hire and sell, and our membership continues to grow at double-digits year-over-year. Time spent watching
videos on the platform was up 36% and comments were up 32% year-over-year. We're also seeing more
members use AI to gain new skills and find jobs. The number of learners who have used AI-powered coaching
increased over 2x quarter-over-quarter, and we remain the market leader in hiring as customers like Equinix and
Verizon use LinkedIn Hiring Assistant to find qualified candidates faster.

When it comes to LinkedIn Premium, we saw over 75% quarter-over-quarter subscriber growth to our premium
pages offering for SMBs. And LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be the best way to reach B2B decision-
makers with two consecutive quarters of accelerated revenue growth.
More broadly, when it comes to advertising, we are transforming how people search, browse, discover content
and use AI as a personal assistant. With Copilot Search in Bing, we are reimagining search results with overview
pages curated by AI and embedded conversational capabilities. With Copilot Vision in Edge, Copilot sees what
you see and gives you real-time responses while you browse.
With Copilot Discover, we are personalizing MSN experience based on user interactions and preferences. And
with our updated Copilot app, we are focused on building daily engagement and successful sessions across a
range of modalities, whether it is conversing, searching, shopping or travel planning. All up, we again took share
across Bing and Edge, and our total advertising revenue across our businesses has surpassed $20 billion over
the past 12 months.
Now on to Gaming. We continue to transform the business and focus on margin expansion as we bring our
games to over 500 million monthly active users across devices. We ended the quarter as the top publisher by
preorders and pre-installs on both Xbox and PlayStation store.
PC Game Pass revenue increased over 45% year-over-year. With Xbox Play Anywhere, players now can access
more than 1,000 games they can play across console and PC. And just last week, we brought cloud gaming to LG
TVs. Cloud gaming set a new record, surpassing 150 million hours played for the first time this quarter. We are
also integrating AI across the Xbox; new Copilot for Gaming is a personalized gaming companion that provides in-
game assistant and expert coaching; and our first-of-its-kind Muse model can generate gameplay in real-time.
Finally, it's fantastic to see the success of the Minecraft movie, which is the top grossing film of the year. In
addition to monetizing our IP in new ways, we have seen a 75%-plus increase in weekly active users of the game
year-over-year since the release.
In closing, we are rapidly innovating to expand our opportunity across both Consumer and Commercial
businesses. In just a few weeks at our Build Conference, we'll share how we are creating the most powerful AI
platform for developers and I encourage you to tune in.
With that, let me turn it over to Amy.

Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone.
This quarter, revenue was $70.1 billion, up 13% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased
11% and 13% in constant currency, while operating income increased 16% and 19% in constant currency, and
earnings per share was $3.46, an increase of 18% and 19% in constant currency. Results exceeded
expectations, driven by focused execution from our sales and partner teams.
We continue to see strong demand for our cloud and AI offerings as they help customers drive productivity,
increase efficiencies and grow their businesses. And again, this quarter, revenue from our AI business was above

expectations. Commercial bookings increased 18% and 17% in constant currency, significantly ahead of
expectations again this quarter driven by an Azure commitment from OpenAI.
We also saw consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued long-term commitments
to our platform. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $315 billion, up 34% and 33% in
constant currency. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 17% year-over-year.
The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 47%.
And this quarter, our annuity mix was 98%. FX was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue,
segment level revenue and operating expense growth. FX decreased COGS growth by only 1 point, 1 point
unfavorable to expectations. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $42.4 billion, ahead of expectations and grew 20% and
22% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 69%, in line with expectations and
decreased 3 points year-over-year, driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure.
Company gross margin percentage was also 69%, down 1 point year-over-year, driven by scaling our AI
infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 2% and 3% in constant currency, lower than expected, due to our
focus on cost efficiencies, as well as investments that shifted to Q4.
Operating margins increased 1 point year-over-year to 46%, better than expected as we continue to focus on
building high-performing teams and increasing our agility by reducing layers with fewer managers. At a total
company level, head count at the end of March was 2% higher than a year ago and was down slightly compared
to last quarter.
Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $29.9 billion and grew 10%
and 13% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by LinkedIn, Microsoft 365 Commercial products,
and Microsoft 365 Consumer. M365 Commercial Cloud revenue increased 12% and 15% in constant currency, in
line with expectations. ARPU growth was again driven by E5 and M365 Copilot.
With M365 Copilot, we continue to see growth across customer segments and geos. Paid M365 Commercial
seats grew 7% year-over-year to over $430 million. While we continue to see installed base expansion across all
customer segments, growth was primarily driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker
offerings. M365 Commercial products revenue increased 5% and 8% in constant currency, ahead of expectations
due to higher-than-expected Office transactional purchasing.
M365 Consumer Cloud revenue increased 10% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by
higher than expected subscription growth, following the January price increase. M365 Consumer subscriptions
grew 9% to $87.7 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 7% and 8% in constant currency. Results were ahead of
expectations due to better than expected performance across all businesses.
The Talent Solutions business continues to be impacted by weakness in the hiring market. Dynamics 365
revenue increased 16% and 18% in constant currency, in line with expectations with continued growth across all
workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 10% and 13% in constant currency, and gross margin
percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure.
Operating expenses increased 1% and 2% in constant currency, and operating income increased 15% and 18%
in constant currency.
Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $26.8 billion and grew 21% and 22% in constant currency,
ahead of expectations driven by Azure. In Azure and other cloud services, revenue grew 33% and 35% in

constant currency, including 16 points from AI services. Focused execution drove non-AI services results, where
we saw accelerated growth in our enterprise customer segment, as well as some improvement in our scale
motions. And in Azure AI services, we brought capacity online faster than expected.
In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 6% and 4% in constant currency, slightly below
expectations driven by renewals with lower in-period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. The year-
over-year decline is reflective of the continued customer shift to cloud offerings.
Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency, slightly ahead of
expectations, due to better than expected performance in Enterprise Support Services. Segment gross margin
dollars increased 13% and 14% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased 4 points year-
over-year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 6% and 7% in constant currency,
and operating income grew 17% and 18% in constant currency.
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.4 billion and grew 6% and 7% in constant currency, ahead
of expectations due to better than expected results across all businesses. Windows OEM and Devices revenue
increased 3% year-over-year, ahead of expectations as tariffs uncertainty through the quarter resulted in
inventory levels that remained elevated.
Search and News Advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 21% and 23% in constant currency. Results were
significantly ahead of expectations, driven by usage from a third-party partnership, better-than-expected rate
expansion and volume growth across Edge and Bing.
And in Gaming. Revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue
increased 8% and 9% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by stronger-than-expected performance
in third-party and first-party content.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 9% and 11% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased 2
points year-over-year driven by strong execution on margin improvement in Search and Gaming. Operating
expenses increased 1%. Operating income increased 21% and 23% in constant currency, driven by continued
prioritization of higher-margin opportunities.
Now, back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $21.4 billion, slightly
lower than expected due to normal variability from the timing of delivery of data center leases. Cash paid for
PP&Es was $16.7 billion.
Roughly half of our cloud and AI-related spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the
next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud and AI spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to
serve customers based on demand signals, including our customer contracted backlog of $315 billion.
Cash flow from operations was $37 billion, up 16%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset
by higher tax payments. And this quarter, free cash flow was $20.3 billion.
Other income and expense was negative $623 million, more favorable than anticipated, primarily due to net gains
on derivatives and investments. Our losses on investments accounted for under the equity method were slightly
higher than expected. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to
shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, an increase of 15% year-over-year.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2025
Now, moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. First, through
April, demand signals across our Commercial businesses as well as in LinkedIn, Gaming and Search have
remained consistent. Our outlook assumes those trends continue in Q4. If the environment changes, our results
may be impacted.
In our Windows OEM business, our outlook assumes the elevated inventory levels from Q3 will come down in Q4.
We have widened our guidance range in our More Personal Computing segment to account for some of this
variability.
Next, FX. With the weakening of the US dollar in April, we now expect FX to increase total revenue growth by 1
point. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by 1 point in Productivity and Business
Processes and less than 1 point in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase
COGS operating expense growth by less than 1 point.
In Commercial bookings, we expect solid growth on a significant prior-year comparable and a growing expiry
base. Bookings growth will be driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued
long-term commitments to our platform.
As a reminder, larger, longer-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive
increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.
Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 67%, down year-over-year, primarily driven by the
impact of scaling our AI infrastructure.
And now, capital expenditures. We expect Q4 capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis. H2 CapEx
in total remains unchanged from our January H2 guidance. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability
from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases.
Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $32.05 billion to $32.35
billion or growth of 11% to 12% in constant currency. M365 Commercial Cloud revenue growth should be
approximately 14% in constant currency, relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. We expect continued
ARPU growth through E5 and M365 Copilot and some seat growth moderation, given the size of the installed
base. M365 Commercial products revenue growth should be in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, M365
Commercial products includes both the Windows Commercial on-premises components of M365 suite and Office
transactional purchasing, both of which can be variable due to in-period revenue recognition dynamics. M365
Consumer Cloud revenue growth should be in the mid-teens, driven by the January price increase.
For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high-single digits. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue
growth to be in the mid to high-teens with continued growth across all workloads.
For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $28.75 billion to $29.05 billion or growth of 20% to 22% in constant
currency. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability,
primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.
In Azure, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be between 34% and 35% in constant currency, driven by strong
demand for our portfolio of services. In our non-AI services, we expect focused execution to continue driving
healthy growth. And in our AI services, while we continue to bring data center capacity online as planned, demand
is growing a bit faster. Therefore, we now expect to have some AI capacity constraints beyond June.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2025
In our on-premises server business, we again expect revenue to decline in the mid-single digits, with the ongoing
customer shift to cloud offerings. And in Enterprise and Partner Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the
mid to high-single digits, driven by enterprise support services.
In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be $12.35 billion to $12.85 billion. Windows OEM and
Devices revenue should decline in the mid- to high-single digits. We expect Windows OEM revenue to decline in
the low- to mid-single digits, assuming OEM inventory levels come down through the quarter, as noted earlier,
although the range of potential outcomes is wider than normal. Devices revenue should decline in the high-teens.
Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the high-teens, even on a strong prior-year
comparable. We expect to see continued growth in both volume and revenue per search, with share gains across
Edge and Bing. Overall, search and news advertising revenue growth should be in the mid-teens. And in Gaming,
we expect revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth to
be in the high-single digits, driven by first-party content.
Now, back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $23.6 billion to $23.8 billion or growth of 19% to 20% in
constant currency, and operating expense of $18 billion to $18.1 billion, or growth of approximately 5% in
constant currency. Therefore, even with ongoing AI investments as we scale, we continue to expect full-year FY
2025 operating margins to be up slightly year-over-year.
Other income and expense is expected to be roughly negative $1.2 billion, primarily driven by investments
accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on
equity method investments. And lastly, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.
Now, I'd like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year. We remain committed to investing
against the strong demand signals we see for our services. So, as a reminder, our earlier comments on FY 2026
capital expenditures remain unchanged. We expect CapEx to grow. It will grow at a lower rate than FY 2025 and
will include a greater mix of short-lived assets, which are more directly correlated to revenue than long-lived
assets. These investments, along with focused execution that delivers near-term value to our customers, will
ensure we continue to lead through the cloud and AI opportunity ahead.
With that, let's go to Q&A, Jonathan.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
Please proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Keith Weiss Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a fantastic quarter. In what all of us are
looking at as a difficult environment, a lot of uncertainty out there, so really impressive to put out the results that
you guys did. One of the things that we heard a lot about this quarter in the media and press reports was
changing data center commitments, maybe Microsoft walking away from some of those data center commitments.
But it sounds like the AI demand is very strong. You're talking about not being able to hit all of that demand with
the supply. So, can you talk to us about what's going on with your data center strategy? Are there any shifts
taking place?
And maybe in particular, Satya, you could talk about some of the comments that you had made about the
potential risk for oversupplies in GPUs out in the future. What exactly was that risk you were talking about? And
are you incorporating that risk into your data center strategy?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Satya Nadella A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Yeah. First of all, thanks, Keith, for the question. The reality is we've always been making adjustments to build,
lease, what pace we build all through the last, whatever, 10, 15 years, it's just that you all pay a lot more attention
to what we do quarter-over-quarter nowadays.
Having said that, the key thing for us is to have our builds and lease be positioned for what is the workload growth
of the future, right? So, that's what you have to goal seek to. So, there's a demand part to it, there is the shape of
the workload part to it, and there is a location part to it. So, you don't want to be upside down on having one big
data center in one region when you have a global demand footprint. You don't want to be upside down when the
shape of demand changes because, after all, with essentially pre-training plus test time compute, that's a big
change in terms of how you think about even what is training, right. Forget inferencing.
So, fundamentally, given all of that, and then every time there's great Moore's Law, but remember, this is a
compounding sort of S curve, right, which is there is Moore's Law, there is system software, there is model
architecture changes, there is the app server efficiency. Given all of that, we just want to make sure we're building
– accounting for the latest and greatest sort of information we have on all of that.
And that's what you see reflected, and I feel very, very good about the pace. In fact, Amy just mentioned, we will
be short power. And so therefore – but it's not power, it's not a blanket statement. I need power in specific places
so that we can either lease or build at the pace at which we want. And so that's the sort of plan that we're
executing to. Maybe, Amy, you can add to that.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2025
Yeah, maybe just to add a little bit to Satya's comments. Just a reminder, these are very long lead time decisions.
From land to build, to build-outs can be lead times of five to seven years, two to three years. So, we're constantly
in a balancing position as we watch demand curves and made the things Satya watch.
And the second part is just to maybe remind you when Satya talks about being short power, he's really talking
about data center space. And so, we've continued through the second half to put things in place. In fact, we talked
a little bit about pulling even some of that space to be ready earlier and being able to deliver that earlier to
customers this quarter, which is really good work by the teams as we continue to get more and more efficient at
that process. And I look forward to being able to continue to do that in the future.
I did talk about in my comments, we had hoped to be in balance by the end of Q4. We did see some increased
demand as you saw through the quarter. So, we are going to be a little short, a little tight as we exit the year but
are encouraged by that.

Operator: The next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brent Thill Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Satya, on your comment about accelerating demand for cloud migrations, I'm curious if you could dig in
and extrapolate a little more what you're seeing there. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Satya Nadella A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Brent. So, I sort of think about three big things that are happening in the cloud all in parallel, and there's
also a relationship between them. One is, I'll just say, the classic migration of whether it's SQL, Windows Server.
And so that sort of again got good steady-state progress, because the reality is, I think everyone is now – perhaps
there's another sort of kick in the data center migrations just because of the efficiency the cloud provides. So
that's sort of one part.
The second piece is good data growth. You saw some – like PostgreS on Azure – I mean, forgetting in SQL
Server, PostgreS on Azure is growing, Cosmos is growing. The analytics stuff I talked about with Fabric. It's even
the others, whether it is Databricks or even Snowflake on Azure are growing. So, we feel very good about Fabric
growth and our data growth.
Then the cloud-native growth. So, this is again before we even get to AI, some of the core compute consumption
of cloud-native players is also pretty, it's very healthy. It was healthy throughout the quarter. We projected to go –
moving forward as well.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2025
Then the thing to notice is the ratio, and I think we mentioned this multiple times before, if you look underneath
even ChatGPT, in fact, that team does a fantastic job of thinking about not only their growth in terms of AI
accelerators they need. They use Cosmos DB, they use PostgreS, they use core compute and storage. And so,
there's even a ratio between any AI workload in terms of AI accelerator to others. So, those are the four pockets,
I'd say, or four different trend lines, which all have a relationship with each other.
And if I step back, and Amy and I talk a lot about this, this time around, there's nothing certain for sure in the
future, except for one thing, which is our largest business is our infrastructure business. And the good news here
is the next big platform shift builds on that. So, it's not a complete rebuild, having gone through all these platform
ships where you have to come out on the other side with a full rebuild. If there is good news here and is – then we
have a good business in Azure that continues to grow and the new platform depends on that. So, we want to stay
disciplined and execute super well on that.

Mark L. Moerdler Q
Analyst, Bernstein Research
Thank you very much for taking my question and I will reiterate what my peers have said. Congratulations on the
great quarter. Satya and Amy, Microsoft is a very different business than it was during the last recession.
Incredible job you've done. If we get into a recession, I hope we don't, how do you think about the stability, the
sustainability, revenue volatility of Microsoft today if we were to get into a recession? Would the business react
early to recession or late, would recession have a more shallow impact on revenue? Any thoughts would be
appreciated.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Satya Nadella A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Maybe I'll start, and then Amy should add, Mark. The way at least I think we will approach it is, quite frankly, be
very focused on how we help our customers if there is any turbulence in the macro, because one of the things
that we feel we can do just because of the efficiencies of the cloud. And the footprint we have and the
differentiated sort of layers of the stack from the SaaS application side to the infrastructure side. I think if you sort
of buy into the argument that software is the most valuable resource we have to fight any type of inflationary
pressure or any type of growth pressure where you need to do more with less, I think we can be super helpful in
that. And so, if anything, we would probably have more of that mindset is how do we make sure we are helping
our customers. And then, of course, we'll look to share gains.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Karl E. Keirstead Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. A number of metrics to applaud, but I think the one that stands out to me is the 16-point growth
rate lift to Azure from AI. Satya and Amy, I just wanted to ask if you could unpack that a little bit. Of course, you
mentioned that you got a bit of a kicker from capacity coming online, but I'm a little bit more interested in where
the demand came in above expectations, like what workload type. It's hard for us to see that on the outside. Was
it a surge in ChatGPT inference that landed in Azure? Was it an uptick in enterprise AI adoption? And Amy, do
you think that 16 points could be higher in June? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Amy E. Hood A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Karl, for the question. Just to provide some clarity because I think your question implies something that
we didn't mean to imply on the call. First, the real outperformance in Azure this quarter was in our non-AI
business. So, then to talk about the AI business, really, what was better was precisely what we said. We talked
about this. We knew Q3 that we had and hadn't really matched supply and demand pretty carefully and so didn't
expect to do much better than we had guided to on the AI side. We've been quite consistent on that.
So, the only real upside we saw on the AI side of the business was that we were able to deliver supply early to a
number of customers. And being able to do that throughout the quarter creates quite a good benefit to us. But the
majority of our outperformance versus where we had expected to be was on the non-AI piece of the business.

Kash Rangan Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hi. Thank you very much. One question for Amy. You've said in the past that you can attain better and better
capital efficiency with the cloud business and probably cloud and AI business. Where do you stand today, Amy
and maybe Satya you can opine as well, that you've said before that you can slow down your CapEx growth rate
while still accelerate Azure, which includes AI. Can we get a mark-to-market on that? Thank you so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Amy E. Hood A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Microsoft Corp.
Maybe I'll start, Kash, and let Satya add on, because I really think when you go back and read some of Satya's
comments, on how the S-curves build on themselves, that's actually the levers that go into the answer of the
question that you're asking. And so, the way, of course, you've seen that historically is right when we went
through the prior cloud transitions, you see CapEx accelerate, you build out data center footprints. You slowly
filled CPU capacity. And over time, you see software efficiencies and hardware efficiencies build on themselves.
And you saw that process for us for goodness now quite a long time.

And what Satya is talking about is how quickly that's happening on the AI side of the business and you add to that
model diversity. So, think about the same levers plus model efficiency, those compounds.
Now, the one thing that's a little different this time is just the pace. And so, when you're seeing that happen pace
in terms of efficiency side, but also pace in terms of the build-out, so it can mask some of the progress. But we
are working hard across all of the teams, hardware, software, even the build teams to get things in place as
quickly as possible, dock-to-live times, all of that is improving and all of that actually is benefiting us.
And I'll go ahead and say, our margins on the AI side of the business are better than they were at this point by far
than when we went through the same transition and the server to cloud transition.

Yeah. I mean I think at a macro level, I think the way to think about this is you can ask the question, what's the
difference between a hosting business and a hyperscale business. It's software. That's, I think, the gist of it. We
asked for sure, it's a capital-intensive business, but capital efficiency comes from that system-wide software
optimization. And that's what makes the hyperscale business attractive and that's what we want to just keep
executing super well on.

Mark R. Murphy Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you so much. Satya, you had commented recently that the DeepSeek moment is a real thing. And you had
said that software efficiencies mean that the fleet will be aged for a longer time. Can you comment on how those
advances are affecting the pace and volume of AI experimentation and activity in the marketplace.
And Amy, could we start to consider the possibility that software enhancements might extend the useful life
assumption that you're using for GPUs? Or is it a little premature to be thinking that way?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Satya Nadella A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Yeah. First of all, I think some of the work that actually OpenAI first pioneered and did with all other reasoning
models and, of course, DeepSeek has sort of added to it and done good work as well and others as well. The

idea that you can have test-time compute plus pre-training and then some of the great optimization at inference
time that has all happened has proven up. I mean, if you look at I would say, for every Moore's Law change and
movement, there's probably a 10x improvement because of software, right? That's sort of what's happening with
these models.
Some of it comes from model architecture, some of that comes from data efficiency, compute efficiency and what
have you. So, that's what we are writing. And we feel that all up, when you have a commodity that is getting that
better, then the question is how do you build out a fleet that's super-balanced, so that then the workloads can be
built and can, in fact, take advantage of that efficiency and the underlying infrastructure.
I mean, it's kind of like virtualization. What was the difference between servers and, sort of, again, client server
with virtualization? It was efficiency. What was the difference between virtualization and cloud? It was efficiency.
What is the difference between this generation of cloud and AI? It's efficiency. So, the more you can, kind of,
continue to think about software driving that efficiency is what drives demand ultimately.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Amy E. Hood A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Microsoft Corp.
And to your specific question, in terms of thinking about the depreciable life of an asset, we like to have a long
history before we make any of those [indiscernible] (00:50:29). So, we're focused on getting every bit of useful life
we can, of course, out of assets. But to Satya's point, that tends to be a software question more than a hardware
one.

Kirk Materne Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Yes. Thanks very much and congrats on a great quarter. Amy, you mentioned that the upside on Azure came
from the non-AI services this time around. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about that. And, I
guess, as you look forward, maybe what's different this go around versus what we saw a few years ago when,
obviously, things like optimization weighed on the growth a little bit? It sounds like the product portfolio is much
broader right now, but just wondering if you could add some color on that front. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Amy E. Hood A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Microsoft Corp.
Sure. And thanks for the question, Kirk. With regards to non-AI, I talked a little bit about this. In general, we saw
better-than-expected performance across our segments, but we saw acceleration in our largest customers. We
call that the enterprise segment in general.

And then, in what we talked about of our scale motions, where we had some challenges in Q2, things were a little
better. And we still have some work to do in our scale motions, and we're encouraged by our progress. We're
excited to stay focused on that as, of course, we work through the final quarter of our fiscal year.
By geo, the performance was pretty consistent. Satya actually highlighted some of the workloads that came in a
little better than we thought. Obviously, just some good consistent work on migrations, good execution by the
sales and partner teams, the data workloads he went through. And so, in general, Kirk, I wouldn't say it's anything
beyond that. I do think it was improved execution, and I was happy to see it, but there's still some work to do on
our scale motions, in particular.

Alex Zukin Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. And again, just amazing congratulations on those Azure numbers, which
I think are, quite honestly, just inspiring. So, maybe, Amy, to the point that you're making that the surprise factor
was on the non-Azure – non-AI side of the house, and it sounds like there's confidence in that continuing beyond.
How much of that are you starting to see the pull in of the non-AI driven by the AI portion of Azure. And on the AI
portion specifically, as test-time compute really just blows out kind of prior conceptions of scaling law challenges,
how much does that change potentially the curve of the AI Azure growth as you go forward here over the next few
quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Amy E. Hood A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Alex. Let me first of all say, I think we've talked about this quite a bit, it's always a good chance to get to
iterate this. It's getting harder and harder to separate what an AI workload is from a non-AI workload. And we've
talked about it this way I think in most instances to make sure people understood that when we were accelerating
all of our CapEx spend over the past 2.5 or 3 years now, the people had confidence that we were turning that into
revenue and product in a way that was transparent and that everyone could understand really the goals that we
have set for ourselves and for our partners and customers in terms of building product that turned to revenue.
But if you take a step back from that, it's that these workloads are being built, GPU, CPU, storage, network, all the
same things. And so, I think really what we're talking about is really how Satya talked about in one of the earlier
questions. We're seeing digital natives, digital natives fill workloads, they do AI work, they do not-AI work. Do they
tend to do that work in the same cloud? Lots of times. Sometimes is it all in the same place? Not all the time, but
that relationship gets stronger and stronger as people pivot to more of AI heavy workloads. And so, I think you're
starting to see some of that relationship. I think we'll continue to see that as AI workloads continue to get built and
experimented with and proof-of-concepts get expanded.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2025
And so, I think I mostly focus on the fact that together, we saw good performance in Q3 on Azure. As you're
inclusive of both components, in terms of our execution, in terms of the skilled and partner teams and backlog and
conversion and interesting workloads and adding customer value and solving real problems and adding real value
and I think that's probably how I would approach that number more than trying to separate it in the way that even
we have talked about it, but for very different reasons.

Satya Nadella
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Jonathan. It was a very strong close to what was a record fiscal year for us. All up, Microsoft Cloud
surpassed $168 billion in annual revenue, up 23%. The rate of innovation and the speed of diffusion is unlike
anything we have seen. To that end, we are building the most comprehensive suite of AI products and tech stack
at massive scale. And to provide more context, I want to walk up the stack, starting with Azure. Azure surpassed
$75 billion in annual revenue, up 34%, driven by growth across all workloads. We continue to lead the AI
infrastructure wave and took share every quarter this year. We opened new DCs across six continents and now
have over 400 data centers across 70 regions, more than any other cloud provider. There is a lot of talk in the
industry about building the first gigawatt and multi-gigawatt data centers.
We stood up more than 2 gigawatts of new capacity over the past 12 months alone. And we continue to scale our
own data center capacity faster than any other competitor. Every Azure region is now AI-first. All of our regions
can now support liquid cooling, increasing the fungibility and the flexibility of our fleet. And we are driving and
riding a set of compounding S curves across silicon, systems and models to continuously improve efficiency and
performance for our customers. Take, for example, GPT-4o family of models, which have the highest volume of
inference tokens. Through software optimizations alone, we are delivering 90% more tokens for the same GPU
compared to a year ago. Beyond the AI fleet, we continue to build our commercial cloud to address customers'
unique data residency and sovereignty requirements.
This quarter, we introduced the Microsoft Sovereign Cloud, the industry's most comprehensive solution spanning
both public and private cloud deployments. All of this innovation is driving our strong results. We saw accelerating
growth from migrations again this quarter. Nestlé, for example, migrated more than 200 SAP instances, 10,000-
plus servers, 1.2 petabytes of data to Azure with near zero business disruption. That makes it one of the largest
and most successful migrations in business history. The next big accelerator in the cloud will be Quantum, and I'm
excited about our progress. In fact, earlier this month, we announced the world's first operational deployment of a
Level 2 quantum computer in partnership with Atom Computing. This is how we will continue to think and make
investments, with decade-long arcs, while making progress every quarter.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call 30-Jul-2025
The next layer is data, which is foundational to every AI application. Microsoft Fabric is becoming the complete
data and analytics platform for the AI era, spanning everything from SQL to NoSQL to analytics workloads. It
continues to gain momentum with revenue up 55% year-over-year and over 25,000 customers. It's the fastest-
growing database product in our history. Fabric OneLake spans all databases and clouds, including semantic
models from Power BI, and therefore, it is the best source of knowledge and grounding for AI applications and
context engineering. Azure Databricks and Snowflake on Azure both accelerated as well. Cosmos DB and Azure
PostgreSQL are both powering mission-critical workloads at scale. OpenAI, for example, uses Cosmos DB in the
hot path of every ChatGPT interaction, storing chat history, user profiles and conversational state.
And Azure PostgreSQL stores metadata critical to the operation of ChatGPT as well as OpenAI's developer APIs.
This year, we launched Azure AI Foundry to help customers design, customize and manage AI applications and
agents at scale. Foundry features best-in-class tooling, management, observability and built-in controls for
trustworthy AI. Customers increasingly want to use multiple AI models to meet their specific performance, cost
and use case requirements. And with Foundry, they can provision inferencing throughput once and apply it across
more models than any other hyperscaler, including models from OpenAI, DeepSeek, Meta, xAI's Grok and, very
soon, Black Forest Labs in Mistral AI. We sim-shipped 15 models from OpenAI alone on Foundry this year,
providing same-day access to state-of-the-art models deeply integrated with our infrastructure and tools.
And we are seeing accelerated adoption of our new Foundry Agent Service, which is now being used by 14,000
customers to build agents that automate complex tasks. For example, Nasdaq is using Foundry to build agents
that help customers prepare for board meetings, cutting prep time by up to 25%. All up, 80% of Fortune 500
already use Foundry. And when we look narrowly at just the number of tokens served by Foundry APIs, we
processed over 500 trillion this year, up over 7x. This is a good indicator of true platform diffusion beyond a few
head apps and services. Talking about the app layer, these applications are becoming embedded in our daily
work and life. Our family of Copilot apps has surpassed 100 million monthly active users across commercial and
consumer.
And when you take a broader look at the engagement of AI features across our products, we have over 800
million monthly active users. Microsoft 365 Copilot is becoming the new way to organize work and workflow and
work artifacts. We rolled out our biggest update to Microsoft 365 Copilot to-date this quarter, bringing together
chat, search, create, notebooks as well as agents into one intuitive scaffolding. With this innovation and continued
product improvements, we are seeing real momentum. Customers continue to adopt Copilot at a faster rate than
any other new Microsoft 365 suite, with strong usage intensity as shown by our week-over-week retention. And
we saw the largest quarter of seat adds since launch with a record number of customers returning to buy more
seats. Barclays, for example, will roll out Microsoft 365 Copilot to 100,000 employees globally following a
successful initial deployment of 15,000.
UBS is expanding its deployment to all of its employees after initially rolling it out to 55,000 of them. And Adobe,
KPMG, Pfizer, Wells Fargo, all purchased over 25,000 seats this quarter. Tens of thousands of organizations
have already used our Researcher and Analyst deep reasoning agents in the first weeks of availability. And we
have introduced group-level agents in Teams like Facilitator and Interpreter which generate real-time translation
and notes in meetings. Hundreds of partners like Adobe, SAP, ServiceNow, and Workday have built their own
third-party agents that integrate with Copilot and Teams. We are also seeing more customers use Copilot Studio
to extend Microsoft 365 Copilot and build their own agents. This year, customers created 3 million agents using
SharePoint and Copilot Studio.
And with Copilot Tuning, they can easily create agents fine-tuned on their company's data, workflow, and style
that reflect their unique tone, language, and expertise. We're also seeing great traction among specific roles and

functions, starting with developers. GitHub Copilot continues to have great momentum in IDE with Agent Mode
and new form factors like Coding agent which is capable of asynchronously executing developer tasks. We have
20 million GitHub Copilot users. GitHub Copilot Enterprise customers increased 75% quarter-over-quarter as
companies tailor Copilot to their own codebases, and 90% of the Fortune 100 now use GitHub Copilot. More
broadly, GitHub usage and repos are seeing explosive growth because of AI. AI projects on GitHub more than
doubled over the last year.
The surge in vibe coding projects and AI coding agents, whether it is Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or GitHub
Copilot are generating more pull requests and more repos on GitHub. And our Code Review agent is being used
heavily across the platform, performing millions of code reviews each month. In healthcare, we had a breakout
year for Dragon Copilot. Customers used our ambient AI solutions to document over 13 million physician-patient
encounters this quarter, up nearly 7x year-over-year. For example, at Mercyhealth system, more than 1,000
physicians are already using Copilot to reduce administrative burden so that they can focus on providing better
care. They have saved more than 100,000 hours to-date and plan to expand to all 5,000 providers. As one
physician put it, the best thing to happen to my practice in 10 years.
And in security, we were the first in the industry to introduce agents to help defenders autonomously handle high-
volume security and IT tasks. More broadly, AI is driving a fundamental change in the biz apps market as
customers shift from legacy systems to agentic business applications. Dynamics 365 took share this year and
we're winning customers in every industry like Verizon with Sales, Domino's Pizza Group with ERP, 1-800-
Flowers with Contact Center. When it comes to consumer apps, we're innovating across all surfaces. In fact, on
Monday we introduced Copilot Mode in Edge. It's especially exciting to see the innovation coming back to
browsers. Copilot Mode brings together Copilot Composer, Chat, Discover, Search, and Actions to build the next
generation of browser for the AI age. Our Copilot consumer app also continue to see strong growth in
engagement and successful sessions.
And we're bringing Copilot to every Windows 11 PC. With Copilot Vision, you can share your screen with Copilot
and get real-time insights and assistance on anything. And we're well-positioned as we approach Windows 10
end-of-support in October thanks to Windows 11 and Copilot+ PCs which offer customers compelling security as
well as AI value. Talking about security, it underlies our cloud and AI infrastructure as well as our Copilots and
agents. We have launched over 100 new capabilities over the past year. Just last week, we added a modern data
lake to our SIEM Microsoft Sentinel, bringing together customer data across our first-party tools as well as third-
party ecosystem over 350 connectors. We're also extending the systems customers already use for governance,
identity, security, and management to protect every AI agent.
Entra now extends identity permissions, policies, and access controls to agents. Defender secures nearly 2
million GenAI apps. Purview is used by three-quarters of the Microsoft 365 Copilot customers to protect their data.
And all up, we now have nearly 1.5 million security customers and continue to take share across all major
categories we serve. Before I wrap, I want to talk about two consumer businesses of ours with massive end-user
reach, LinkedIn and Xbox. LinkedIn is home to 1.2 billion members with four consecutive years of double-digit
member growth. All up, comments on LinkedIn rose over 30% and video uploads increased over 20% this year.
We continue to bring AI to every part of LinkedIn experience, introducing agents across hiring as well as sales.
When it comes to gaming, we have 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices. We are now
the top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation this quarter with successful launches of Forza Horizon 5 and
Oblivion Remastered. The Call of Duty franchise has never been stronger. 50 million people have played Black
Ops 6; total hours surpassed 2 billion. Minecraft saw record monthly active usage and revenue this quarter thanks
in large part to the success of the Minecraft movie. And we have nearly 40 games in development, so much,

much more to come. We surpassed over 500 million hours of gameplay stream via the cloud this year, and Game
Pass annual revenue was nearly $5 billion for the first time.
In closing, we are going through a generational tech shift with AI, and I have never been more confident in
Microsoft's opportunity to drive long-term growth and define what the future looks like.
With that, let me turn it over to Amy to walk through our financial results as well as the outlook.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Amy E. Hood
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This year, we delivered over $281 billion in revenue, up 15%
year-over-year, which reflects the broad strength of our products and services. Operating income was over $128
billion, up 17% year-over-year as we invested against the expansive opportunity ahead. And in our largest quarter
of the year, we significantly exceeded expectations with strong execution by our sales and partner teams. As
Satya shared, we're innovating faster than ever to deliver new value to our customers. This quarter, revenue was
$76.4 billion, up 18%, and 17% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 16% and 15% in constant
currency, while operating income increased 23% and 22% in constant currency. And earnings per share was
$3.65, an increase of 24% and 22% in constant currency.
For the first time, commercial bookings were over $100 billion, increasing 37% and 30% in constant currency on a
strong prior year comparable. Strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals
as well as an increase in the number of $10 million and $100 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft
365 helped drive these results. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $368 billion, up 37%
and 35% in constant currency. Roughly 35% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 21% year-
over-year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 49%. And this quarter, our
annuity mix was again 98%. FX was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, segment level
revenue, COGS and operating expense growth.
Microsoft Cloud revenue was $46.7 billion, ahead of expectations, and grew 27% and 25% in constant currency.
Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was slightly better than expected at 68%, down 2 points year-over-year
from the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by continued efficiency gains in Azure and M365
Commercial Cloud. Company gross margin percentage was 69%, down 1 point year-over-year, driven by sales
mix shift to Azure and the lower Microsoft Cloud gross margin noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 6%
and 5% in constant currency, and operating margins increased 2 points year-over-year to 45%. Better-than-
expected revenue growth coupled with a focus on operating efficiently drove the margin expansion. At a total
company level, head count at the end of June was relatively unchanged year-over-year.
Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $33.1 billion and grew 16%
and 14% in constant currency, better than expected, driven by M365 Commercial products and cloud services
and M365 Consumer products and cloud services. M365 Commercial cloud revenue was ahead of expectations
and increased 18% and 16% in constant currency, with 2 points of benefit from in-period revenue recognition.
Business trends remained relatively stable to the prior quarter when excluding the end-period revenue
recognition, with ARPU growth again driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. Paid M365 commercial seats grew 6% year-
over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments, though primarily in our small and medium
business and frontline worker offerings.
M365 Commercial products revenue increased 9% and 7% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to
higher-than-expected Office 2024 transactional purchasing. M365 Consumer cloud revenue was better than

expected, increasing 20% driven by ARPU growth following the January price increase and subscriber growth of
8%. LinkedIn revenue increased 9% and 8% in constant currency with growth across all businesses, though
Talent Solutions continues to be impacted by weakness in the hiring market. Dynamics 365 revenue increased
23% and 21% in constant currency, with strong execution in our core annuity sales motions leading to growth
across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, and gross
margin percentage increased slightly, driven by the efficiency gains noted earlier, even as we deliver more AI
features across our products and scale our AI infrastructure.
Operating expenses increased 7% and 6% in constant currency, and operating income increased 21% and 19%
in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $29.9 billion and grew 26% and 25% in
constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by Azure and our on-premises server business. In Azure and
other cloud services, revenue grew 39%, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by accelerated growth in our
core infrastructure business, primarily from our largest customers. As a reminder, new cloud and AI workloads are
built and scaled using the breadth of our services. Revenue from Azure AI services was generally in line with
expectations. And while we brought additional data center capacity online this quarter, demand remains higher
than supply.
In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2% and 3% in constant currency, ahead of expectations,
primarily driven by transactional purchasing, which also has higher end-period revenue recognition. Enterprise
and partner services revenue increased 7% and 6% in constant currency with growth in Enterprise Support
Services partially offset by a decline in Industry Solutions. Segment gross margin dollars increased 17% and 16%
in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased 4 points year-over-year driven by scaling our AI
infrastructure, partially offset by Azure efficiency gains noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 6% and 4% in
constant currency and operating income grew 23%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.5 billion
and grew 9%, exceeding expectations, primarily due to Windows OEM as well as Xbox content and services.
Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 3% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, as inventory levels
remained elevated. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 21% and 20% in constant currency,
driven by continued growth in both volume and revenue per search, as well as roughly 8 points of favorable
impact from third-party partnerships, including the benefit of a low prior year comparable. And in Gaming, revenue
increased 10%. Xbox content and services revenue increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, driven by
better-than-expected performance from first-party content and Xbox Game Pass. Segment gross margin dollars
increased 15%. Gross margin percentage increased 3 points year-over-year with improvement across all
businesses. Operating expenses increased 4% and 3% in constant currency.
Operating income increased 34% and 33% in constant currency, driven by continued prioritization of higher
margin opportunities. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures were $24.2 billion, including $6.5
billion of finance leases where we recognize the full value at the time of lease commencement. Cash paid for
PP&E was $17.1 billion. The difference is primarily due to finance leases. More than half our spend was on long-
lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining spend was primarily
for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, and driven by strong demand signals. Cash flow from operations was $42.6
billion, up 15%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier payments. And
this quarter, free cash flow was $25.6 billion.
Other income and expense was negative $1.7 billion, primarily due to losses on investments accounted for under
the equity method. Our effective tax rate was approximately 17%. And finally, we returned $9.4 billion to
shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, bringing our total cash return to shareholders to over $37
billion for the full fiscal year. Now moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter is

on a US dollar basis, unless specifically noted otherwise. Let me start with some full year commentary for FY
2026. First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase full year revenue growth and
COGS growth by approximately 2 points and to increase operating expense growth by 1 point. Next, building on
the strong momentum we saw this past year, we expect to deliver another year of double-digit revenue and
operating income growth in FY 2026.
We will continue to invest against the expansive opportunity ahead across both capital expenditures and
operating expenses given our leadership position in commercial cloud, strong demand signals for our cloud and
AI offerings, and significant contracted backlog. Capital expenditure growth, as we shared last quarter, will
moderate compared to FY 2025 with a greater mix of short-lived assets. Due to the timing of delivery of additional
capacity in H1, including large finance lease sites, we expect growth rates in H1 will be higher than in H2. We
remain focused on delivering revenue growth and increasing our operational agility. And as a result, we expect
operating margins to be relatively unchanged year-over-year. And finally, we expect our FY 2026 effective tax rate
to be between 19% and 20%. Now to our outlook for the first quarter. Based on current rates, we expect FX to
increase total revenue growth by 2 points.
Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by roughly 3 points in Productivity and Business
Processes and roughly 1 point in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase
COGS and operating expense growth by roughly 1 point. In commercial bookings, we expect healthy growth on a
growing expiry base. Bookings growth will again be driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales
motions and long-term commitments to our platform. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are
more unpredictable in their timing, drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud
gross margin percentage should be roughly 67%, down year-over-year, driven by the impact of continuing to
scale our AI infrastructure. We expect Q1 capital expenditures be over $30 billion, driven by the continued strong
demand signals we see.
As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of
delivery of finance leases. Next, to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect
revenue of $32.2 billion to $32.5 billion or growth of 14% to 15% with roughly 3 points of benefit from FX as noted
earlier. In M365 Commercial cloud, we expect revenue growth to be between 13% and 14% in constant currency
with business trends that remain relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. ARPU growth will again be driven
by E5 and M365 Copilot. M365 Commercial products revenue growth should be in the mid to high single digits. As
a reminder, M365 Commercial products includes both the Windows Commercial on-premises components of
M365 suite and Office transactional purchasing, both of which can be variable due to in-period revenue
recognition dynamics.
M365 Consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the low 20s driven by the January price increase. For
LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to
be in the high teens with continued growth across all workloads. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $30.1
billion to $30.4 billion or growth of 25% to 26% with roughly 1 point of benefit from FX as noted earlier. Revenue
will continue to be driven by Azure, which can have quarterly variability in year-on-year growth rates depending on
the timing of capacity delivery and when it comes online, as well as from in-period revenue recognition depending
on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth of approximately 37% in constant currency driven
by strong demand for our portfolio of services on a significant base.
Even as we continue bringing more data center capacity online, we currently expect to remain capacity-
constrained through the first half of our fiscal year. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to
decline in the low to mid-single digits with the ongoing customer shift to cloud offerings. In More Personal

Computing, we expect revenue to be $12.4 billion to $12.9 billion. Windows OEM and Devices revenue should
decline in the mid to high single digits. We expect the elevated inventory levels at the end of Q4 to come down
through the quarter in Windows OEM, although the range of potential outcomes remains wider than normal.
Devices revenue should decline. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the low to
mid-teens, down sequentially as growth rates normalize following the benefit from third-party partnerships noted
earlier.
Growth will continue to be driven by volume and revenue per search across Edge and Bing. Overall search and
news advertising revenue growth should be in the low double digits. And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline
in the mid to high single digits. Against a strong prior year comparable, we expect Xbox content and services
revenue to decline in the mid-single digits. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $24.3 billion to
$24.5 billion or growth of 21% to 22% and operating expense of $15.7 billion to $15.8 billion or growth of 5% to
6%. Other income and expense is estimated to be negative $1.3 billion primarily due to investments accounted for
under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method
investments. And lastly, we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%.
In closing, we finished the year with double-digit revenue and operating income growth and exceeded the FY
2025 operating margin commitment we shared a year ago. Our focus remains on investing in security, quality,
and AI platform and product innovation that delivers value and opportunity to our customers. We are excited for
FY 2026.
With that, let's go to Q&A, Jonathan.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with
Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Keith Weiss Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a fantastic end to FY 2025. I've been covering
Microsoft for a while. I don't think I've ever seen a quarter where like everything came together this well, so
congratulations on that execution. Maybe a little bit longer-term-focused question to start out: You guys have
always had software startups as customers and potentially emerging competitors, but the AI labs now feel
different. Investors are ascribing valuations which assume these companies become major players in software.
They're underwriting revenue forecasts measure in the tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions. And these
startups have also grown to be some of your biggest customers, so they're contributing significantly to Microsoft
today.
So, it seems like there's a lot of potential opportunity in supporting those businesses, but also it's not certain that
they're going to stay your customers as they scale. They could insource some of that infrastructure and they very
likely emerge as potential competitors. So, as managers of Microsoft, as managers of the capital, how do you
guys manage that risk versus reward with these quickly emerging AI labs and these AI startups?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Satya Nadella A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Keith, for the question. I don't think it's that different from even sort of the previous era. There's always
been, I'll call it, head apps or new companies that emerge that, in fact, are very needed in order to birth a new
platform. Back in the day, when I was getting started on Azure, I used to look over the lake and sort of see Netflix
and Amazon and I'd say I wish Netflix ran on Azure. And in some sense, that's kind of what we now have, which
is the largest AI workloads run on Azure. And when that happens, you learn the workload faster, you optimize the
entire platform faster. Everything from what we're doing with Cosmos DB for a chat interface like ChatGPT or
Copilot, is, guess what, going to be most relevant for any AI application going forward.
The entire data stack that we have now built is going to be optimized for what people describe as one of the
hardest challenges of any AI application called context engineering, right, which is how do you collect your data
and then make sure that the context around the prompts remain stable over a long period so that you get the
intelligence to actually deliver the results you want. So, these are workload results that are invaluable for us to
learn to build both the products as well as the platform. And then broadly, they – or rather over time, there will be
broad diffusion. In fact, one of the things that Amy and I track is not just the head app usage but also what's the
sort of all the Tier 2 applications that are being built.
So, that speaks a little bit, Keith, to, I think, your question, is as long as we have head apps shaping the platform,
and then after that, we have the broad diffusion happen, which in some sense both of those is what we have
seen. So, I feel very good about our being in even standing going forward.

Mark L. Moerdler Q
Analyst, Bernstein Research
Thank you. I'd also give you my congratulations. Amazing. I didn't know how you were going to beat last quarter,
and you did it. So congratulations. And thank you for taking my question. Satya and Amy, we're now two-plus
years into the GenAI revolution and adoption is still early and ramping. What do you think is the best way that
software companies are going to be able to monetize AI for SaaS? Do you believe there are differences in
monetization for horizontal more general apps like M365 Copilot or Dynamics CRM Copilot versus very targeted
capacities on the agentic side? And also, how should you think about the trajectory of SaaS AI margins over the
long-term? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Satya Nadella A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Yes. I'll start, and Amy, you should feel free to add. I mean if I just broaden out beyond just SaaS as a category, I
think just like the server to cloud transition was an expansion of essentially usage of servers, that is essentially
what happened with the cloud, right, which is we did a bunch of servers except that the expertise required, the
capital required, the time required to bring up servers, build it out, scale it, was just all hard. And so therefore, the
market was a certain size. Whereas with the cloud, you could sort of buy it with flexibility, you could burst and you
could spin up and spin down, the expertise required came down. So, it was just orders of magnitude.
That's what's happening. So, if you sort of even subscribe to this point of view that intelligence is basically log of
compute, that means compute is going to grow and you've got to use it as efficiently as possible to just keep
creating intelligence. Now how does it manifest beyond just the infrastructure? I kind of – to Keith's earlier
question, I talked a little bit about how the infrastructure is getting shaped, data layer is getting shaped, the app
server is getting built. These are all classic categories of infrastructure that'll continue, but there will be an order or
two of magnitude more. So literally, like – in fact, one of the other things we track is every GPU requires storage
and compute. That ratio is another thing that is really exponential for infrastructure growth. So, when you go to the
app layer, the SaaS apps themselves are now building in effectively agentic and chat interfaces with intelligence.
And they're also building autonomous agents. Agents are kind of like applications, like a database application
perhaps, but they are being used increasingly inside of a user interaction. I think a good example is GitHub
Copilot. It got started as an code completions on an IDE. Then we added a chat interface to it. Then we added the
agent mode to it. And now we have an autonomous agent, which in fact works completely asynchronously, right.
So, all those four things are now part of essentially GitHub. And by the way, it also turns out that every other tool
that is also doing any form of coding is adding more and more GitHub repos. So, if I have to think about GitHub
monetization, we have an opportunity around just monetizing GitHub Enterprise and then we have the ability to
think about GitHub Copilot, and GitHub Copilot as with all these form factors.
And so that's exactly the same thing that's happening with Microsoft 365. That's the same thing that's happening
with Dynamics 365. So, you have to be very open to taking your data tier, your business logic tier and UI tier and
sort of being more expansive in it. As long as you do that, it's just that usage goes up, and that's what I think
shows up in the results.

Amy E. Hood A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Microsoft Corp.
And I think, Mark, if you wanted to think about all the things in the layers that you talked about, is really we're
seeing very similar monetization tools exist in this transition too, right. There's a per user logic, there's tiers of per
user. Sometimes those tiers relate to consumption, sometimes there's pure consumption models. I think you'll
continue to see a blending of these, especially as the AI model capability grows, you'll end up with ways that
teams are going to want to throttle that usage, use the best models for the best job. And I think the blending of
these models will continue to be something we see on a go-forward basis.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Karl E. Keirstead Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. Satya and Amy, this is the second quarter in a row of pretty material Azure upside from what
sounds like an acceleration in on-prem to Azure migration activity. I'm just wondering if you can comment on the
plethora of customer conversations you've had, whether there are a couple of two or three specific catalysts that
are driving that migration. And how durable a trend do you think that is? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Satya Nadella A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Yes. Three things are really happening. One is the migrations. A good example would be what I referenced in my
remarks with Nestlé, with the SAP instances, they moved along with a lot of the data that's associated with it in a
bunch of servers. So, that's kind of a classic example. I think whether it's VMware migrations or migrations of SAP
or even just our own server migrations, they're pretty healthy. And it turns out that we're still not anywhere close to
the finish line, at best maybe in the middle innings of that. The second thing that's also happening is cloud-native
applications that are scaling. This is even excluding all of the AI stuff, just the classic cloud native e-commerce
company let's say. These are scaling in a big way.
And some of those customers were not on Azure previously, but now they're increasingly there because they
have come for AI perhaps but they now stay for more than AI. And so to me, that's another thing you see in
overall what's happening across the Azure number. And then, of course, there are the new AI workloads, so those
are three things that are all, in some sense, building on each other, but that's kind of what's driving our growth.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brent Thill Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Satya, back to the strength across the board in the quarter. Was there anything that jumped out at you or
surprised you that you didn't think you were going to see but you did see in the quarter? Just the magnitude of
upside, I think, had shocked many here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Satya Nadella A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Yeah. I don't know, Brent, if anything really surprised us. But I think what we are noticing in our own build-out of
these AI applications and in general is the platform becoming more than here is a model and here is an API,
make some calls, right? I mean, that's, in some sense, was a bit of the state-of-the-art maybe even a year ago.
Whereas now, you have essentially these very stateful app patterns that are emerging that require quite a bit of
rethinking of even the app stack. I mean, take even the storage-tier stuff, right? The degree of sophistication you
have and, hey, how much of an index do you really want to build by preprocessing so that your prompt
engineering or context engineering as I call it can be better and higher quality. So, I think all of that is emerging.
So, when I look at a product like Azure Search, Fabric, and Cosmos DB, all of the things, the frameworks around
it are just becoming robust to build serious applications. And so, that's what I feel great about, is the learning
curve inside the company, outside the company, the diffusion of the stack, the speed with which that's emerging
that you can build application is much faster, right? I always go back and say, hey, when – I don't know, our
relational database came out, it took a while for people to build an ERP system, let's say. And this thing, we're
kind of building pretty sophisticated applications at a very, very fast clip based on, I think, the degree of maturity
that's emerging.

Perfect. Thank you. Congrats from me as well. I had one question on Copilot, and I'm obviously a happy user
here at Barclays. If you think about it, the one thing that we're all realizing is Copilot is the AI part but data is
becoming more and more important, and then from there on we can start thinking about agents. What are you

seeing in your customer conversations, Satya, about like that understanding that Copilot is actually just the
starting point and then from there on it's becoming like much, much broader? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Satya Nadella A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Yeah. I think that that's right. Even inside of Copilot, I'm sure you're seeing it, right, you now have Analyst and
Researcher, to just talk about two examples, and of course all the third-party agents. So, yeah, there is a lot more
of – it's just not request/response. It's about spawning essentially applications that then go to work and come
back. But the UI still remains very important, right, even for asynchronous work. To instruct the asynchronous
work, you need UI. And to monitor asynchronous work, you need UI. Maybe different, it may not be a chat
interface. And of course, you need a way to then inspect what the asynchronous work is, right?
So, even take the example I was giving on GitHub. Even if you're not using GitHub Copilot to create the code
check-in or the pull request, interestingly enough we're seeing massive increase to GitHub Copilot Code Review
Agent even if you used maybe Claude Code or whatever else to write the code. So that's, I think, what's
happening across all of these systems. So, you're absolutely right that it starts with some kind of a UI that's more
chat-focused but it quickly goes beyond it. And you see it in M365, you see it in Dynamics 365, and you see it in
GitHub.

Hi. Thank you very much. Amy, I want to acknowledge that I think a few quarters ago you said that you'll reach a
point in time where you can accelerate Azure while slowing down CapEx, so you did it. But what is the outlook?
When I look at the CapEx guidance for the upcoming quarter, certainly I would view that as a positive indicator of
the book of business you have for your cloud services. But how should we think about the shape of the curve of
CapEx vis-à-vis Azure growth rate in the years ahead, particularly as I listen to Satya's comments on the AI stack
consuming more and more infrastructure? Are we at a point where we're going to have to continue to do this and
we magically wait for inference and applications to kick in and, therefore, create a richer gross margin mix? Thank
you so much for your comments and congrats on the quarter.

Amy E. Hood A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Kash. Let me back up and first say, when you think about the full year comments I've made on CapEx as
well as the Q1 guidance of over $30 billion, you first have to ground yourself in the fact that we have $368 billion
of contracted backlog we need to deliver, not just across Azure, but across the breadth of the Microsoft Cloud. So,
in terms of feeling good about the ROI and the growth rates and the correlation, I feel very good that the spend

that we're making is correlated to basically contracted on the books business that we need to deliver and we need
the teams to execute at their very best to get the capacity in place as quickly and effectively as they can.
And so when you look – and we've talked about the growth rate will decline year-over-year, but at its core, our
investments, particularly in short-lived assets like servers, GPUs, CPUs, networking storage, is just really
correlated to the backlog we see and the curve of demand. And I talked about, my gosh, in January and said I
thought we'd be in better supply demand shape by June. And now I'm saying, I hope I'm in better shape by
December. And that's not because we slowed CapEx even with accelerating the spend and trying to pull leases in
and get CPUs and GPUs in the system as quickly as we can, we are still seeing demand improve. And so I am
not as focused, Kash, on trying to pick a date at which revenue growth and CapEx growth will meet and cross. I'm
focused on building backlog, building business and delivering capacity, which we are seeing has a good ROI
today in terms of our ability to get that done.
So, I don't want people to get overly focused on a pivot point. Because when you're in sort of these expansive
moments, picking a data point usually means you're going to pick to be too conservative in terms of market share
gain and in terms of winning. And so, I tend to put my energy more there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Satya Nadella A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Yeah. I think one of the other things, Kash, is that – I think I said this in the previous earnings as well, which is the
difference between a hoster and a hyperscaler is software. And the same is going to be true here. That GPT-4o
example I gave is all software, right, the optimization even in the last year. So, we know how to use the software
skills to take any piece of hardware and make it multiple-x better. And so that's kind of where the yield will come.
But as Amy said, while you're really going and building out the plant, you don't want to sort of serialize it. You just
want to go in paddle on all of these fronts, and that's sort of what will compound over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Amy E. Hood A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Microsoft Corp.
And I do think it's important, when Satya talks about the software layer, he is talking about in his comments, to
connect this back to the compounding S curves. And so I would remind people, that is something that we saw
through the prior cloud transition, it's how we operated through that one. And the same sort of skills and logic
done at an even faster pace is what will apply the same transition.

Q4 2025 Earnings Call 30-Jul-2025
Hey. Great. Thanks very much for taking the questions and congrats from me as well on the metrics working in
concert here. Amy, maybe on margin, impressive to hear expectations for flat operating margin in the upcoming
year as you absorb some of the mix shift towards Azure and some of the more AI-focused offerings. Can you
speak in more detail just around your ability to manage those trade-offs and offset some of the mix shift? And I'm
wondering specifically just on any productivity gains you're seeing from leveraging AI internally that you'd highlight
or anything else you just mention in underpinning the full year expectation there? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Amy E. Hood A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Michael. I think really the area to focus on is, when you think about margin, I think sometimes people get
a lot of energy around cost control as a driver of margin. The other driver is to focus on making sure you deliver
great product that's competitive and innovative and can take share, because that drives revenue. And revenue
itself and revenue growth, as you all know better, even perhaps than I do, is a durable way to see margin
improvement. It builds on itself. That being said, the second thing I would point to is really what I talked to Kash a
little bit about before, Satya and I both mentioned it, is applying all of our skill set here to deliver efficiencies,
whether that's whatever layer of the stack that is, the S curves compound, and we are doing that work, and we're
focused on it. At the same time, we're doing the build out. So, you'll see improvements there even as we continue
to invest.
And then, of course, it's about continuing to have great talent here, focus on products and opportunities where we
have the biggest markets and the most likelihood of success. And so when we have those three things happen
and the energy is right and the focus is there, it gives me confidence in terms of margin delivery. But make no
mistake, it starts and ends really with product, which is what we're really focused on here, and delivering that to
customers.

And now, I'll turn the call over to Sundar.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks Jim, and hello everyone. We delivered another strong quarter in Q4, driven by our leadership in AI and
our unique full-stack approach. We are making dramatic progress across compute, model capabilities, and in
driving efficiencies. We are rapidly shipping product improvements and seeing terrific momentum with consumer
and developer usage; and we are pushing the next frontiers from AI agents, reasoning and deep research to
state-of-the-art video, quantum computing and more.
The company is in a great rhythm and cadence, building, testing, and launching products faster than ever before.
This is translating into product usage, revenue growth, and results.
In Search, AI Overviews are now available in more than 100 countries. They continue to drive higher satisfaction
and Search usage. Meanwhile, Circle to Search is now available on over 200 million Android devices.
In Cloud and YouTube, we said at the beginning of 2024 that we expected to exit the year at a combined annual
revenue run rate of over $100 billion. We met that goal and ended the year at a run rate of $110 billion. We are
set up well for continued growth.
So, today, I'll provide an update on our AI progress and how it's improving our core consumer products. Then I'll
touch on Cloud, YouTube, platforms, and devices, and Waymo.
Let's start with AI. Last quarter, I outlined the three areas of our differentiated full-stack approach to AI innovation.
Our leading AI infrastructure, our world-class research, including models and tooling, and our products and
platforms that bring these innovations to people at scale.
First, AI infrastructure. Our sophisticated global network of cloud regions and data centers provides a powerful
foundation for us and our customers, directly driving revenue.
We have a unique advantage because we develop every component of our technology stack, including hardware,
compilers, models, and products. This approach allows us to drive efficiencies at every level from training and
serving to developer productivity.
In 2024, we broke ground on 11 new cloud regions and data center campuses in places like South Carolina,
Indiana, Missouri, and around the world. We also announced plans for seven new subsea cable projects
strengthening global connectivity. Our leading infrastructure is also among the world's most efficient.
Google data centers deliver nearly four times more computing power per unit of electricity compared to just five
years ago. These efficiencies, coupled with the scalability, cost and performance we offer are why organizations
increasingly choose Google Cloud's platform. In fact, today, Cloud customers consume more than eight times the
compute capacity for training and inferencing compared to 18 months ago. We'll continue to invest in our Cloud
business to ensure we can address the increase in customer demand.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 04-Feb-2025
Second, world-class research, including models. In December, we unveiled Gemini 2.0, our most capable AI
model yet, built for the agentic era. We launched an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 Flash, our workhorse
model with low latency and enhanced performance. Flash has already rolled out to the Gemini app, and
tomorrow, we are making 2.0 Flash generally available for developers and customers, along with other model
updates. So, stay tuned.
Late last year, we also debuted our experimental Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model. The progress to scale thinking
has been superfast and the review so far have been extremely positive. We are working on even better thinking
models and look forward to sharing those with the developer community soon.
Gemini 2.0's advances in multimodality and native tool use enable us to build new agents that bring us closer to
our vision of a universal assistant. One early example is Deep Research. It uses agentic capabilities to explore
complex topics on your behalf and give key findings along with sources. It launched in Gemini Advanced in
December and is rolling out to Android users all over the world.
We are seeing great product momentum with our consumer Gemini app, which debuted on iOS last November.
And we have opened up trusted tester access to a handful of research prototypes, including Project Mariner,
which can understand and reason across information on a browser screen to complete tasks, and Project Astra.
We expect to bring features from both to the Gemini app later this year.
We are also excited by the progress of our video and image generation models: Veo 2, our state-of-the-art video
generation model; and Imagen 3, our highest-quality text-to-image model. These generative media models, as
well as Gemini, consistently top industry leader boards and score top marks across industry benchmarks. That's
why more than 4.4 million developers are using our Gemini models today, double the number from just six months
ago.
And we continue to drive research breakthroughs in quantum computing. At the end of last year, we announced
Willow our new state-of-the-art quantum computing chip that can reduce errors exponentially as we scale up
using more qubits. Willow is an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical
applications. This technology holds so much promise, which is why there was real excitement around this
breakthrough.
Third, our products and platforms put AI into the hands of billions of people around the world. We have seven
products and platforms with over 2 billion users and all are using Gemini. That includes Search where Gemini is
powering our AI Overviews. People use Search more with AI Overviews and usage growth increases over time as
people learn that they can ask new types of questions. This behavior is even more pronounced with younger
users who really appreciate the speed and efficiency of this new format.
We are also pleased to see how Circle to Search is driving additional search use and opening up even more
types of questions. This feature is also popular among younger users. Those who have tried Circle to Search
before now use it to start more than 10% of their searches. As AI continues to expand the universe of queries that
people can ask, 2025 is going to be one of the biggest years for Search innovation yet.
Now, let me turn to key highlights from the quarter across Cloud, YouTube, Platforms and Devices and Waymo.
First, Google Cloud. Our AI-powered Cloud offerings enabled us to win customers such as Mercedes-Benz,
Mercado Libre and Servier. In 2024, the number of first-time commitments more than doubled compared to 2023.

We also deepened customer relationships. Last year, we closed several strategic deals over $1 billion, and the
number of deals over $250 million doubled from the prior year. Our partners are further accelerating our growth
with customers purchasing billions of dollars of solutions through our Cloud Marketplace.
We continue to see strong growth across our broad portfolio of AI-powered cloud solutions. It begins with our AI
Hypercomputer, which delivers leading performance and cost across both GPUs and TPUs. These advantages
help Citadel with modeling markets and training and enabled Wayfair to modernize its platform, improving
performance and scalability by nearly 25%.
In Q4, we saw strong uptake of Trillium, our sixth-generation TPU, which delivers 4 times better training
performance and 3 times greater inference throughput compared to the previous generation.
We also continue our strong relationship with NVIDIA. We recently delivered their H200-based platforms to
customers. And just last week, we were the first to announce a customer running on the highly anticipated
Blackwell platform.
Our AI developer platform, Vertex AI saw 5x increase in customers year-over-year, with brands like Mondelēz
International and WPP building new applications and benefiting from our 200-plus foundation models. Vertex
usage increased 20x during 2024 with particularly strong developer adoption of Gemini Flash, Gemini 2.0, Imagen
3 and, most recently, Veo.
We're also seeing strong growth in our AI-powered databases, data analytics, and cybersecurity platforms.
Customers, including Radisson Hotels are now using Gemini to search and analyze multimodal data from across
multiple clouds.
Our AI-powered Threat Intelligence and security operations products help customers, including Vodafone and
AstraZeneca, identify, protect and defend against threats.
Our growing portfolio of AI applications is also seeing strong customer adoption. In Q4, we introduced Google
Agentspace, which helps enterprises synthesize data with Google-quality search, create Gemini-powered agents,
and automate transactions for employees.
In addition, we recently gave all Google Workspace business and enterprise customers access to all of our
powerful Gemini AI capabilities to help boost their productivity.
Moving to YouTube. Nielsen data shows YouTube continues to be number one in streaming watch time in the US,
with our share of streaming now at a record high. On election day alone, over 45 million viewers across the US
watched election-related content on YouTube.
Our early investment in Podcasts is paying off. We integrated Podcasts into the core YouTube experience,
particularly with video. We are now the most frequently used service for consuming podcasts in the US according
to a recent Edison report. This success reflects our long-term approach of investing in emerging trends from
mobile to the living room.
We now have over 250,000 creators in the YouTube shopping affiliate program in the US and Korea alone. We
expand YouTube with shopping at the end of last year to three additional countries allowing even more creators to
share their favorite products with fans and grow their businesses. Philipp will talk more about YouTube
performance later in the call.

Next, platforms and devices. Google One's performance has been outstanding and is one of our fastest-growing
subscription products in terms of subscribers and revenue growth. Last month, we announced the first beta of
Android 16, plus new Android updates, including a deeper Gemini integration coming to the new Samsung Galaxy
S25 series. We also recently announced Android XR, the first Android platform built for the Gemini era. Created
with Samsung and Qualcomm, Android XR is designed to power an ecosystem of next-generation extended
reality devices like headsets and glasses.
Finally, a few words on Waymo, which made tremendous progress last year, safely serving more than 4 million
passenger trips. It's now averaging over 150,000 trips each week and growing. Looking ahead, Waymo will be
expanding its network and operations partnerships to open up new markets, including Austin and Atlanta this
year, and Miami next year. And in the coming weeks, Waymo One vehicles will arrive in Tokyo for their first
international road trip. We are also developing the sixth-generation Waymo Driver, which will significantly lower
hardware costs.
I want to thank our employees around the world for another great quarter. 2025 is going to be exciting, and we are
all ready for it. Philipp, I'll hand it over to you.

Chief Business Officer & Senior Vice President, Google, Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. I'll quickly cover performance for the quarter, then frame the rest of my
remarks around the progress we're delivering across Search, Ads, YouTube and partnerships, highlighting the
impact AI is having on our business and our customers.
Google Services revenues were $84 billion for the quarter, up 10%, driven primarily by 11% year-on-year growth
in advertising revenues. Strong growth in Search and YouTube advertising was partially offset by year-on-year
decline in network revenues.
In terms of vertical performance, the 13% increase in Search and other revenues was led by financial services
followed by retail. The 14% growth in YouTube advertising revenues was driven by strong spend on US election
advertising with combined spend from both parties almost doubling from what we saw in the 2020 elections.
Now in Q4, we saw continued strong growth in revenues from Search. We had lots of exciting updates in
December, and we are rapidly integrating our AI innovation into our consumer experiences. We've already started
testing Gemini 2.0 in AI Overviews and plan to roll it out more broadly later in the year.
In Search, we're seeing people increasingly ask entirely new questions using their voice, camera or in ways that
were not possible before, like with Circle to Search. We're making these benefits available to more consumers.
Google is already present in over half of journeys where a new brand product or retailer are discovered. By
offering new ways for people to search, we're expanding commercial opportunities for our advertisers.
Shoppers can now take a photo of a product and using Lens quickly find information about the product, reviews,
similar products and where they can get it for a great price. Lens is used for over 20 billion visual search queries
every month and the majority of these searches are incremental.
Retail was particularly strong this holiday season, especially on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which each
generated over $1 billion in ad revenue. Interestingly, despite the US holiday shopping season being the shortest
since 2019, retail sales began much earlier in October, causing the season to extend longer than anticipated.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 04-Feb-2025
People shop more than 1 billion times a day across Google. Last quarter, we introduced a reinvented Google
shopping experience, rebuilt from the ground up with AI. This December saw roughly 13% more daily active users
in Google shopping in the US, compared to the same period in 2023.
Closing out on Search with travel and sharing another interesting trend where we saw spend expand to Travel
Tuesday. This contributed to 20% year-on-year revenue growth for Travel advertisers across Cyber Monday and
Travel Tuesday.
Moving to Ads. We continue investing in AI capabilities across media buying, creative and measurement. As I've
said before, we believe that AI will revolutionize every part of the marketing value chain. And over the past
quarter, we've seen how our customers are increasingly focusing on optimizing the use of AI.
As an example, Petco, used Demand Gen campaigns across targeting, creative generation, and bidding to find
new pet parent audiences across YouTube. They achieved a 275% higher return on ad spend and a 74% higher
click-through rate than their social benchmarks.
On media buying, we made YouTube Select Creator takeovers generally available in the US and will be
expanding to more markets this year. Creators know their audience the best and creator takeovers help
businesses connect with consumers through authentic and relevant content.
Looking at Creative, we introduced new controls and made reporting easier in PMax, helping customers better
understand and reinvest into their best-performing assets. Using asset generation in PMax, Event Tickets Center
achieved a 5 times increase in production of creative assets saving time and effort. They also increased
conversions by 300% compared to the previous period when they used manual assets.
And finally, measurement. Last week, we made Meridian, our marketing mix model, generally available for
customers, helping more business reinvest into creative and media buying strategies that they know work. Based
on the Nielsen meta-analysis of marketing mix models, on average, Google AI-powered video campaigns on
YouTube delivered 17% higher return on advertising spend than manual campaigns.
Turning to YouTube. We saw robust revenue growth backed by continued growth in watch time across ad-
supported and premium experiences. Our focus here remains on building a streaming platform that enables
creators to thrive and unlock the full potential of AI.
Expanding on our state-of-the-art video generation model, we announced Veo 2, which creates incredibly high-
quality video in a wide range of subjects and styles. It's been inspiring to see how people are experimenting with

We continue to invest in helping YouTube creators work with brands. All advertisers globally can now promote
YouTube creator videos and ad campaigns across all AI-powered campaign types and Google Ads, and creators
can tag partners in their brand videos.
Sephora used Demand Gen's shorts only channel to boost traffic and brand searches for their holiday gift card
campaign and leverage creator collaborations to find the best gift. This drove an 82% relative uplift in searches for

Shorts continues its ascent and is closing the gap with long-form. In 2024, the monetization rate of Shorts relative
to in-stream viewing increased by more than 30 percentage points in the US, and we expect to make additional
progress in 2025.
We're making it easier for advertisers to benefit from Shorts on all screens. We're particularly excited by its
success on Connected TV, which now makes up 15% of shorts viewing in the US
Using a combination of ad formats, Louis Vuitton reached their overall objectives on both long-form and short-
form content. Their shorts exceeded luxury goods benchmark for average view duration by 89% for equivalent
video lengths, while their long-form content exceeded the benchmark by over 15%, with strong engagement from
Gen Z and Millennials.
Looking into the Living Room. We continue to be number one in streaming watch time in the US for nearly two
years according to Nielsen. And our share of streaming is at a record high. Viewers globally streamed over 1
billion hours of YouTube content daily on their TVs in 2024. YouTube makes multiyear investments to tap into
shifting consumer behavior. The current Search and Living Room viewership directly reflects years of work to
build the right products and partnerships. Creators are now prioritizing high-quality viewing experiences that truly
shine on TV screens, inspiring even more viewers to tune in. In fact, the number of creators making a majority of
revenue from TV is up over 30% year-on-year.
We have also invested in Podcast, where popular shows like Club Shay Shay and Lex Fridman are increasingly a
visual format. YouTube creators and viewers are embracing this. In 2024, people watched over 400 million hours
of podcast each month on Living Room devices alone. YouTube is now the most popular service for podcast
listening in the US according to Edison.
As always, let me wrap with the strong momentum we're seeing in partnerships where the breadth of what Google
has to offer is increasingly being recognized. Sundar mentioned our deepening partnership with Samsung.
Another expanding partnership is with Citi, who is modernizing its technology infrastructure with Google Cloud to
transform employee and customer experiences. Using Google Cloud, it will improve its digital products, streamline
employee workflows and use advanced high-performance computing to enable millions of daily computations.
This partnership also fuels Citi's Generative AI initiatives across customer service, document summarization and
search to reduce manual processing.
With that, allow me a moment to thank Googlers everywhere for their extraordinary commitment and to our
customers and partners for their continued trust. Anat, over to you.

Thank you, Philipp. We're pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing across the business as Alphabet
revenue for 2024 reached $350 billion, up 14% on a reported basis, and 15% in constant currency versus 2023.
My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise.
I will start with the results at the Alphabet level and will then cover our segment results. I'll end with some
commentary and expectations for the first quarter and full year 2025.
We had another strong quarter in Q4 with robust momentum across the business. Consolidated revenue of $96.5
billion increased by 12% in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to
revenue growth followed by Cloud.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 04-Feb-2025
Total cost of revenue was $40.6 billion, up 8%. TAC was $14.8 billion, up 6%. We continue to see a revenue mix
shift with Google Search growing at double-digit levels, while network revenues, which have a much higher TAC
rate, declined. Other cost of revenue was $25.8 billion, up 9%, with the increase primarily driven by content
acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, followed by depreciation due to increasing investments in our technical
infrastructure.
Growth in content acquisition and depreciation were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in hardware costs
due to the shift in timing of our Made by Google launches to the third quarter 2024 compared to the fourth quarter
of 2023. In terms of total expenses, the year-over-year comparisons reflect $1.2 billion in exit charges that we
took in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with actions to optimize our global office space. As previously
disclosed, those charges were allocated across the expense lines in other cost of revenue and OpEx based on
associated head count.
Total operating expenses decreased 1% to $24.9 billion. R&D investments increased by 8%, primarily driven by
increase in compensation and depreciation expenses, partially offset by the impact of charges for office space
optimization in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Sales and marketing expenses decreased 5%, primarily reflecting the optimization charges last year as well as
declines in compensation and in ads and promotion expenses due to the timing shift of the Pixel launch from Q4
to Q3. G&A expenses declined by 15%, reflecting a shift of timing in our charitable contributions as well as the
optimization charges last year.
Operating income increased 31% this quarter to $31 billion, and operating margin increased to 32%, representing
4.6 points of margin expansion. Net income increased 28% to $26.5 billion, and earnings per share increased
31% to $2.15. We delivered free cash flow of $24.8 billion in the fourth quarter and $72.8 billion for the full year
2024. We ended the quarter with $96 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Turning to segment results. Google Service revenues increased 10% to $84.1 billion, reflecting the strong
momentum across Google Search and YouTube Ads. Google Search and other advertising revenues increased
by 13% to $54 billion. The robust performance of Search was once again broad-based across verticals, led by the
financial service vertical due to strength in insurance, followed by retail.
YouTube advertising revenue increased 14% to $10.5 billion, driven by brand, followed by direct response
advertising. Network advertising revenue of $8 billion were down 4%. In the fourth quarter, the year-over-year
comparison in all of our advertising revenue lines was impacted by the increase in strength in advertising revenue
in Q4 2023, in part from APAC-based retailers.
Subscription platforms and device revenues increased 8% to $11.6 billion, primarily reflecting growth in
subscription revenues, partially offset by the shift in timing of the launch of our Made by Google devices to the
third quarter compared with the fourth quarter in 2023. We continue to have significant growth in our subscription
products, primarily due to increase in the number of paid subscribers across YouTube TV, YouTube Music
Premium and Google One.
With regards to platform, we saw a slight increase in the growth rate in Play, primarily due to a strong increase in
the number of buyers. Google Service operating income increased 23% to $32.8 billion, and operating margin
increased from 35% to 39%, representing a meaningful margin expansion.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 04-Feb-2025
Turning to the Google Cloud segment, which continued to deliver very strong results this quarter. Revenue
increased by 30% to $12 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in GCP, across core GCP products, AI
Infrastructure and Generative AI Solutions. Once again, GCP grew at a rate that was much higher than Cloud
overall. Healthy Google Workspace growth was primarily driven by increase in average revenue per seat.
Google Cloud operating income increased to $2.1 billion and operating margin increased from 9.4% to 17.5%.
We're pleased with the work the Cloud team is doing to deliver valuable solutions to customer and generate
revenue growth as well as its continued focus on driving efficiencies across the Cloud business.
As for Other Bets, for the fourth quarter, revenue were $400 million and the operating loss was $1.2 billion. The
year-over-year decline in revenue and increase in operating loss primarily reflect the milestone payment in the
fourth quarter of 2023 for one of the Other Bets.
Turning to Alphabet-level activities, the largest component of this line is our investments in AI research and
development activities, which support all of Alphabet. As a reminder, Alphabet-level activities have included
nearly all severance charges from reductions in workforce and office space charges.
In the fourth quarter of 2024, the biggest factor in year-over-year comparison is the $1.2 billion in charges in the
fourth quarter of 2023, almost entirely in connection with office space optimization.
With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the fourth quarter was $14 billion, primarily reflecting investments
in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component being investment in servers, followed by data centers to
support the growth of our business across Google Services, Google Cloud, and Google DeepMind.
In Q4, we returned value to shareholders in the form of $15 billion in share repurchases and $2.4 billion in
dividend payments. Overall, we returned a total of nearly $70 billion to shareholders in 2024.
Turning to 2025, I would like to provide some commentary on several factors that will impact our business
performance in both the first quarter and the full year 2025. First, in terms of revenue, I'll highlight two items that
will have meaningful impact on Q1 revenues across the company.
The first is the impact of foreign exchange rates. At the current spot rates, we expect a larger headwind to our
revenues from the strengthening of the US dollar relative to key currencies in Q1 versus Q4 2024.
Second is the impact of leap year. We expect a headwind from having one less day of revenue in Q1 2025,
compared with leap year in the first quarter of 2024. As for our segments, Google Services, Advertising revenue
in 2025 will be impacted by lapping the strength we experienced in the financial service vertical throughout 2024.
And in Cloud, given that revenues are correlated with the timing of deployment of new capacity, we could see
variability in Cloud revenue growth rates depending on when new capacity comes online during 2025.
Moving to investments, starting with our expectation for CapEx for the full year 2025. As we mentioned on the Q3
call, as we expand our AI efforts, we expect to increase our investments in capital expenditure for technical
infrastructure, primarily for servers followed by data centers and networking.
We expect to invest approximately $75 billion in CapEx in 2025, with approximately $16 billion to $18 billion of
that in the first quarter. The expected total investment level may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, primarily due to
timing of deliveries and construction schedules.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 04-Feb-2025
In terms of expenses, first, the increase in our investment in CapEx over the past few years will increase pressure
on the P&L, primarily in the form of higher depreciation. In 2024, we saw 28% year-over-year growth in
depreciation as we put more technical infrastructure assets into service. Given the increase in CapEx investments
over the past few years, we expect the growth rate in depreciation to accelerate in 2025.
Second, we expect some head count growth in 2025 in key investment areas such as AI and Cloud. As you just
heard from Sundar, we're delivering products and solutions to customers at a rapid pace, building, testing and
launching products faster than ever before. And as I mentioned on the Q3 call, we're doing that while also
focusing on driving further efficiencies in how we operate the business.
Before we take questions, I'd like to recap the financial results for the year. For the full year 2024, revenue grew
by 14%, or by $43 billion, reaching $350 billion. Google Services and Google Cloud each continue to see double-
digit revenue growth, coupled with margin expansion. YouTube and Cloud revenues combined ended the year at
$110 billion annual run rate. And in 2024, we generated total income of $112 billion, an increase of 33% from
2023.
We're pleased with the momentum we're seeing in AI innovation and monetization. We've been using AI to
improve the performance of our Ads business for well over a decade, and Cloud is generating billions in annual
revenue from AI infrastructure and Generative AI solutions. We're also excited about the potential to bring new
experiences to users that will provide additional opportunities for monetization. And I look forward to sharing more
on our progress throughout the year.
Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions.

Brian Nowak Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, one for Sundar, one for Anat. Sundar, maybe kind of step back on
Search. There's a – it seems like there's a lot of advances to come with GenAI and Agentic possibilities with
Search. Can you just sort of walk us through your big picture vision over the next few years of how you think
about your Search product continue to evolve to stay at the top of the funnel and drive more engagement and
monetization for your users and advertisers?
And then the second one, Anat, I think about 90 days ago, you talked about sort of further efficiencies in areas of
simplification on the OpEx base. Can you just sort of walk us through some examples of where you see the
potential for further efficiencies to the OpEx base, excluding the D&A step-ups that we have to come in 2025?
Thanks.

Thanks, Brian. On Search, obviously, we view, I mean, this has been a long continual journey. AI Overviews has
been the next step. It's playing out positively. As we have indicated, the metrics look great. And we are obviously
trading on that experience, bringing better and better models, expanding to the number of queries where it works
and so on. But there's a lot more to come. I think we'll continue bringing AI in more powerful ways – in multi-modal
ways, things like what we have done with Lens, Circle to Search. You can imagine the future with Project Astra.
You can also imagine areas like we have done in Gemini Deep Research, possibilities where you are really
dramatically expanding the types of use cases for which Search can work, things which don't always get
answered instantaneously, but can take some time to answer. Those are all areas of explorations, and you will
see us putting newer experiences in front of users through the course of 2025. And so I do feel the opportunity
space with AI, there's a lot of unlock ahead.

Anat Ashkenazi A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Google, Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks. And for the question with regards to where do we see, or where do I see leverage moving forward and
some of the comments I've made on the previous call?
I certainly see opportunities for further productivity and efficiency, and this is one of our priority areas. And we're
going to do that, so that we can make sure we continue to invest in areas such as AI and Cloud where we see
potential for continued growth.
I'll remain focused on areas that I've mentioned before, which include the technical infrastructure. So the $75
billion in CapEx I mentioned for this year, the majority of that is going to go towards our technical infrastructure,
which includes servers and data centers. So ensuring we do that in the most efficient way is critical.
Second is, managing head count growth, and we're going to be investing in areas of growth, such as AI and
Cloud, but looking across the organization and moderating that growth will be important.
Optimizing the real estate footprint is one of the areas I've mentioned, we're continuing to focus on that. As well
as looking at how we simplify the organization. We previously mentioned bringing like areas together.
Sundar talked about bringing some of the AI research teams together so that we can operate with increased
speed, but also how we operate within the organization, using our own AI tools to how you run the business,
whether it's the code that Sundar mentioned on the previous call, writing code with AI or even running some of our
key processes using AI tools.
So we're looking at all that. It's going to – this is not a one-quarter type of effort. It's going to continue throughout
the year. And we're going to continue to focus on that so that we can support the growth in other areas.

expanded rollout of ads on AI Overviews and perhaps what additional things you may have learned in 4Q?

And I guess, in particular, just curious, if you rolled out to a higher percentage of commercial queries? And is it
still fair to say that you're monetizing nearly on par with existing Search?
And then Anat, just on the on Cloud growth, a little bit of decel 3Q to 4Q, but it sounded like you also suggested
that you were capacity constrained in the fourth quarter. I just wanted to push on that a little bit more how – is that
accurate? And is it fair to say that revenue growth could have been higher with much more capacity? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philipp Schindler A
Chief Business Officer & Senior Vice President, Google, Alphabet, Inc.
So on your first question, first of all, AI Overviews, which is really nice to see, continue to drive higher satisfaction
and Search usage, so that's really good.
And as you know, we recently launched the ads within AI Overviews on mobile in the US, which builds on our
previous rollout of ads above and below. And as I talked about before, for the AI Overviews, overall, we actually
see monetization at approximately the same rate, which I think really gives us a strong base on which we can
innovate even more.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anat Ashkenazi A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Google, Alphabet, Inc.
On the Cloud question. So first, I'm excited that we ended the quarter at $12 billion and a 30% year-over-year
growth, very impressive growth. And as I mentioned in the prepared remark, GCP grew at a much higher rate
than overall Cloud.
Two items to think about, from a deceleration perspective, the first is we are lapping a very strong quarter of an
[ph] AI (00:39:18) deployment in Q4 of 2023. The second is the one you've alluded to, we do see and have been
seeing very strong demand for our AI products in the fourth quarter in 2024.
And we exited the year with more demand than we had available capacity. So we are in a tight supply-demand
situation, working very hard to bring more capacity online. As I mentioned, we've increased investment in CapEx
in 2024, continue to increase in 2025, and we'll bring more capacity throughout the year.

Eric J. Sheridan Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Thank you for taking the question. I'll just ask one. Sundar, with the news that came out of China a little over two
weeks ago, I think investors have been asking a lot of questions about the long-term cost curve for AI as AI
moves from the infrastructure layer to the application layer or from training to inference and maybe even custom
silicon becomes more dominant across the theme. I would love to get your perspective on your take on that news
a couple of weeks ago and what it might mean for Alphabet longer term? Thank you.

Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks, Eric. Look, I think there's been a lot of observations on DeepSeek. First of all, I think a tremendous team.
I think they've done very, very good work. Look, I think for us, it's always been obvious over time, there's frontier
model development, but you can drive a lot of efficiency to serve these models really, really well. And if you look
at one of the areas in which the Gemini model shine is the Pareto frontier of cost performance and latency. And if
you look at all three attributes, I think we lead this Pareto frontier.
And I would say both our 2.0 Flash models, our 2.0 Flash thinking models, they are some of the most efficient
models out there, including comparing to DeepSeek's V3 and R1. And I think a lot of it is our strength of the full
stack development, end-to-end optimization, our obsession with cost per query, all of that, I think, sets us up well
for the workloads ahead, both to serve billions of users across our products and on the Cloud side.
A couple of things I would say are if you look at the trajectory over the past three years, the proportion of the
spend towards inference compared to training has been increasing, which is good because, obviously, inference
is to support businesses with good ROIC. And so, I think that trend is good. I think the reasoning models, if
anything, accelerates that trend because it's obviously scaling up on inference dimension as well.
And so, I think – look, I think part of the reason we are so excited about the AI opportunity is we know we can
drive extraordinary use cases because the cost of actually using it is going to keep coming down, which will make
more use cases feasible, and that's the opportunity space. It's as big as it comes, and that's why you're seeing us
invest to meet that moment.

Michael Brian Nathanson Q
Analyst, MoffettNathanson LLC
Thank you. I have two, one for Philipp and one for Anat. Philipp, a question for you is we're starting to see more
AI tools on e-commerce sites and something like research with AI recommendations is on Google Shopping. Can
you talk about how that product and other AI tools are impacting shopping behavior and how that's impacting
monetization?
And then, I guess the $75 billion question, Anat, is how do we think about long-term capital intensity for this
business? It sounds like there's a bit of constraint in terms of getting things built, but how do we think or how do
you think about the modeling of capital intensity going forward? And what are the things that you're looking
forward to in terms of whether or not this is the right level of spend? Thank you.

Philipp Schindler A
Chief Business Officer & Senior Vice President, Google, Alphabet, Inc.
Look, excellent question. We've been using our advances in AI to make search for products on Google even
easier, obviously. And in Q4, we actually introduced quite a transformed Google Shopping experience, which we
rebuilt from the ground up with AI.

And people shop more than a billion times a day across Google. Last quarter, we introduced this fully reinvented
Google Shopping experience. In December, we saw roughly – I mentioned there's 13% more daily active users in
Google Shopping in the US compared to the same period last year. So, that's a good development here.
And the new Google Shopping experiences, specifically to your question, uses AI to really intelligently show the
most relevant products, helping to speed up and simplify your research. You get an AI-generated brief with top
things to consider for your search, plus maybe products that meet your needs.
So, shoppers very often want low prices. So, the new page not only includes like deal finding tools like price
comparison, price insights, price tracking throughout, but there's also a new and dedicated personalized deals
page, where you can browse deals for you and all this is really built on the backbone of AI. So, we think this is a
very interesting opportunity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anat Ashkenazi A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Google, Alphabet, Inc.
And on the question of capital expenditure, and I think you may have two questions in there. One is just the
capital intensity and then how would we think about return on that invested capital.
So on the first one, certainly, we're looking ahead, but we're managing very responsibly with a very rigorous, even
internal governance process, looking at how do we allocate the capacity and what would we need to support the
customer demand externally, but also across the Google – the Alphabet business.
And as you've seen in the comment I've just made on Cloud, we do have demand that exceeds our available
capacity. So, we'll be working hard to address that and make sure we bring more capacity online.
We do have the benefit of having a very broad business, and we can repurpose capacity, whether it's through
Google Services or Google Cloud, to support, as I said, whether it's Search or GDM, or Google Cloud customers,
we can do that in a more efficient manner.
We also look at every investment that we make to ensure that we're doing it in the most cost-efficient way to
optimize our data center. As you know, our strategy is mostly to rely our own self design and build data centers.
So, they're industry-leading in terms of both cost and power efficiency at scale.
We have our own customized TPUs. They're customized for our own workload, so they do deliver outstanding
superior performance and CapEx efficiency. So, we're going to be looking at all that when we make decisions as
to how we're going to progress capital investments throughout the coming years.

Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Sundar, I just wanted to follow up to Brian's question from earlier. With your
own Project Mariner efforts and a competitor's recent launch, seems there's suddenly really strong momentum on
AI consumer agents and kind of catching up to that old Google Duplex vision.
I think when you look a few years ahead, where do you see consumer agents going? And really, what does it
mean to Google Search outside of Lens? Is there room for both to flourish? Or will they eventually be in conflict
with each other? Thank you.

Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Look, I think, first of all, we are definitely seeing a lot of progress in the underlying capabilities of these models.
Gemini 2.0 was definitely built with the view of enabling more agentic use cases. And so I actually – and we are
definitely seeing progress inside, and I think we'll be able to do more agentic experiences for our users.
Look, I actually think all of this expands the opportunity space. I think, historically, we've had information use
cases, but now you can have – you can act on your information needs in a much deeper way. It's always been our
vision when we have talked about Google Assistant, et cetera. So, I think the opportunity space expands. I think
there's plenty of – it feels very far from a zero-sum game. There's plenty of room, I think, for many new types of
use cases to flourish.
And I think for us, we have a clear sense of additional use cases we can start to tackle for our users in Google
Search. And all the early work with AI Overview shows that users will react positively to that. So I'm pretty excited
about what's ahead.

Ross Sandler Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. One on infrastructure and then one, Anat, on the guidance on revenue. So Sundar, if we look at the
inference cost per 1 million tokens and not the API pricing we see for Gemini versus something like GPT-4, but
the raw cost of generating inference tokens on your TPU stack. How much more efficient do you think you guys
are in terms of generating 1 million tokens compared to inference costs running on your Cloud peers? Do you see
this as an advantage as everything shifts to inference?
And then, Anat, you called out lapping the financial services category strength in 2025 as a bit of a problem for
Search. Could you just quantify a little bit of that? Is that kind of the same as when you guys talk about lapping the
Asia outbound advertiser channel? Any numbers you could put around that headwind? Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Ross, look, the whole TPU project started, our V1 was effectively an inferencing chip. So we've always – part of
the reason we have taken an end-to-end stack approach is that – so that we can definitely drive a strong
differentiation in end-to-end optimizing and not only on a cost, but on a latency basis and a performance basis, be
it the Pareto frontier we mentioned. And I think our full stack approach and our TPU efforts all play – give a
meaningful advantage.

And we plan – you already see that, I know you asked about the cost, but it's effectively captured. When we price
outside, we pass on that differentiation. It's partly why we've been able to bring forward flash models at very
attractive value props, which is what is driving both developer growth. We've doubled our developers to 4.4 million
in just about six months. Vertex usage is up 20x last year. And so all of that is a direct result of that approach, and
so we'll continue doing that.

And on the question regarding my comment on lapping the strength in financial services, this is primarily related
to the structural changes with regards to insurance. So it's more specifically within financial services, it was the
insurance segment. And we saw that continue, but it was a onetime kind of a step-up and then we saw it
throughout the year. I'm not going to give any specific numbers as to what we expect to see in 2025.
But I'm pleased with the fact that we're seeing, and continuing to see, strength across really all verticals, including
retail and exiting the year in a position of strength. If anything, I would highlight as you think about the year, the
comments I've made about the impact of FX as well as the fact that we have one less day of revenue in Q1.

Justin Post Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Great. Thank you. A couple for Philipp, you mentioned higher Search usage with Overviews. Just wondering how
you're feeling about overall Search usage. Is it accelerating as you integrate more AI? I know there's a lot of traffic
growth at competitors with AI, but just wondering, if you're seeing a real increase in total volumes of information
gathering?
And then second on YouTube, thinking about kind of maybe a move from more professional content to user-
generated content. What is that doing for your usage? And how do you think about the margin impact from that?
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Maybe Justin on Search usage overall, look, our metrics are healthy. We are continuing to see growth in Search
on a year-on-year basis in terms of overall usage.
Of course, within that, AI Overviews has seen stronger growth, particularly across all segments of users, including
younger users, so it's being well received. But overall, I think through this AI moment, I think Search is continuing
to perform well.
And as I said earlier, we have a lot more innovations to come this year. I think the product will evolve even more.
And I think as you make Search – as you give – as you make it more easy for people to interact and ask follow-up
questions, et cetera, I think we have an opportunity to drive further growth.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 04-Feb-2025
And some color on your YouTube question. Look, YouTube ads overall had a very healthy growth in Q4 driven by
brand, followed by direct response. The US election advertising led brand revenue growth, and we saw nearly
double the spending from 2020.
I mentioned that. We also had a strong contribution from finance, retail and the tech verticals. So overall strong
operating metrics, watch time growth remains robust, particularly in key monetization opportunity areas such as
Shorts and Living Room, just to set the stage here one more time.
On your question specifically, on the UGC side, look, we have a very strong position with creators. And we've
always said creators are at the center of YouTube's success here. And they're the number one most important
thing we care about.
And this strong position really gives us a lot of confidence here. Today, we have more than three million channels
that are actually in the YouTube partner program, which is really an incredible program. So we're very confident
with the position we have and where this goes.

Kenneth James Gawrelski Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo & Co.
Thank you very much. Two, please. I want to focus on Gemini and the consumer agent side. Sundar, there was
some press reports that suggested you have an ambitious goal on growing the usage by the end of 2025. Two
questions on that, please.
First, what's the – how should we think about the approach that you're going to employ to achieve this goal? Is it
more aggressive marketing for Gemini as a standalone product? Or is it tighter integration into existing
experiences, whether it be Search, mail, maps, et cetera?
And then the second one is, how should we think about the future monetization opportunity of Gemini? Today, it's
really a premium subscription offering or a free offering. Over time, do you see an ad component? And anything
you can share on that, please? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
First of all, we've had a strong momentum for Gemini on the app side, particularly through the second half of
2024. And some of it is, we've made it more easily accessible. We've brought it to, for example, with a dedicated
app on iOS, which has been super positively received and definitely getting a lot of traction there.
So definitely driving organic growth by putting the product out, we just last week rolled out with our 2.0 series of
models. So 2.0 Flash, I mean I think that's one of the most capable models you can access at the free tier. So
that's definitely contributing as well.

And so we are rapidly trading. We've had a couple of key innovations there. Gemini Live, I think, has been
definitely a hit with users as well as for advanced users Gemini Deep Research. So I think a combination of
innovation continually trading on the product and making it better, is driving a lot of usage. And we'll have lot more
to come as we go ahead this year, and we're obviously – have a partnership with Samsung. So there are other
things which will contribute to it as well.
On the monetization side, obviously, for now, we are focused on a free tier and subscriptions. But obviously, as
you've seen in Google over time, we always want to lead with user experience. And we do have very good ideas
for native ad concepts, but you'll see us lead with the user experience. But I do think we're always committed to
making the products work and reach billions of users at scale. And advertising has been a great aspect of that
strategy. And so just like you've seen with YouTube, we'll give people options over time. But for this year, I think
you'll see us be focused on the subscription direction.

During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future
growth opportunities, our opportunity to win new business, our expectations regarding Atlas consumption growth,
the impact of non-Atlas business and multi-year license revenue, the long-term opportunity of AI, our financial
guidance and underlying assumptions and our investments and growth opportunities in AI.
These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and
financial conditions that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For discussion of material
risks and uncertainties that are going to affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our
quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2025 filed with the SEC on June 4, 2025.
Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no
obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures
on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release on the Investor Relations portion of our

Thank you, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. Before discussing our strong quarter, I want to
remind everyone about our upcoming Investor Day, which will take place on September 17 at the Javits Center in
New York City during our MongoDB.local conference. We'll spend a day discussing the investments we're making
to drive durable growth and margin expansion and our view of the future. I look forward to seeing you there.
Now, on to Q2. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter as we continue to execute against a large market
opportunity. Let me start with our results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of
$591 million, up 24% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 29% year-over-
year, representing 74% of total revenue. We delivered non-GAAP operating income of $87 million or a 15% non-
GAAP operating margin, and we ended the quarter with over 59,900 customers.

Q2 2026 Earnings Call 26-Aug-2025
Atlas performance was strong, accelerating to 29% year-over-year growth, up from 26% in Q1. Our customer
additions were also robust. We have added over 5,000 customers over the last two quarters. These results reflect
the strength of MongoDB's platform, our flexible document model, expanded capabilities like Search and Vector
Search, enterprise readiness, and the ability to run anywhere.
Many of our recently added customers are building AI applications, underscoring how our value proposition is
resonating for AI and why MongoDB is emerging as a key component of the AI infrastructure stack. At the same
time, we significantly outperformed on operating margin, demonstrating that we can drive durable revenue growth
while expanding profitably.
In short, our results show that customers are choosing MongoDB. Let me tell you why. First, MongoDB is an
enterprise-ready database capable of meeting the most stringent enterprise requirements. Over 70% of the
Fortune 500 as well as 7 of the 10 largest banks, 14 of the largest 15 healthcare companies, 9 of the 10 largest
manufacturers globally are MongoDB customers. MongoDB is a battle-tested enterprise platform relied on by
some of the most sophisticated and demanding organizations in the world in part because of our strong enterprise
posture across security, durability, availability, and performance.
Atlas enable one of the world's largest automakers to overcome Postgres' scalability and flexibility limits while
reducing complexity. The company's management console attracts over 8.5 million vehicles, requiring a modern
schema to handle both structured and unstructured data, something Postgres could not handle. Ultimately, Atlas
consolidated infrastructure, accelerated innovation, and supported the scale of millions of connected vehicles.
Second, MongoDB is suitable for a broad range of use cases, including the most mission-critical and transaction-
intensive applications. MongoDB has also supported full asset transactions for more than six years, ensuring
strong consistency and data integrity at scale. This is why some of the world's most demanding transactional
workloads run on MongoDB today.
For example, Deutsche Telekom selected MongoDB Atlas as the foundation for its internal developer platform
which includes mission-critical workloads like contract management, device purchases, and billing for 30 million
customers. With 90 Atlas clusters managing over 60 million customer records, Deutsche Telekom's customer data
platform now handles 15 times the concurrent logging for legacy systems. By consolidating these high-volume,
transaction-intensive applications of MongoDB, Deutsche Telekom has improved resiliency, accelerated
innovation, and delivered a step change in customer engagement.
Third, MongoDB has redefined what's core for the database by natively including capabilities like Search, Vector
Search, embeddings, and Stream Processing. Comparing MongoDB to another database like Postgres is not an
apples-to-apples comparison. Take a global e-commerce application that manages inventory and order data,
while enabling product discovery through sophisticated search across millions of SKUs.
The choice for this application not between MongoDB or Postgres; is between MongoDB or Postgres plus other
offerings like Pinecone, Elastic, and Cohere for embeddings. MongoDB's complete solution allows developers to
spend less time stitching together and maintaining a patchwork of disparate systems and more time building
differentiated functionality that drives the business forward.
For example, Agibank, a Brazilian neobank with 2.7 million active customers, migrated their content management
system storing customer records on Postgres to Atlas. As data volumes grew, Postgres' inflexibility and task
execution latency drove performance issues and the database-like sophisticated secondary indexes and full tech
search, hurting sales of core offerings such as loans, insurance, and card approvals.

Q2 2026 Earnings Call 26-Aug-2025
Agibank was constantly updating the database and manually scaling infrastructure, which is both time-consuming
and error-prone. With Atlas, Agibank gained a resilient, flexible system that handled rising demand and support
new services, delivering nearly 5 times better performance and 90% lower costs, all with no outages.
Fourth, MongoDB is emerging as a standard for AI applications. Over the last few quarters, we've seen a strength
in our self-serve channel, driven in part by AI native startups choosing Atlas as the foundation for their
applications. In the enterprise segment, adoption is real, but early. Much of the activity today centers on employee
productivity tools and packaged ISV solutions.
Enterprises are still in the very early stages of building their own custom AI applications that will transform their
business. We consistently hear from customers that when teams try to scale from vibe coder prototypes built on
relational back ends to enterprise-grade deployments, these platforms quickly hit limits in flexibility, scalability,
and performance.
Across startups and increasingly enterprises, our unified platform is resonating strongly. In the enterprise
segment, a leading electric vehicle company chose Atlas and Vector Search to power its autonomous driving
platform. After testing Vector Search against Postgres PG Vector for their in-vehicle voice assistant, they selected
MongoDB for superior performance at scale and stronger ROI. They now rely on Atlas to handle over 1 billion
vectors and expect 10 times growth in data usage by next year.
DevRev, a well-funded, AI-native platform with proven founders disrupting the helpdesk market, built AgentOS, its
complete agentic platform that autonomously handles billions of monthly requests on Atlas. DevRev accelerate
development velocity, lower cost, and scale globally with low latency by using Atlas. AgentOS also leverages
Atlas Vector Search for semantic search, enriching its knowledge graph and LLMs with domain-specific content.
Companies in nearly every industry and across every geography are choosing MongoDB because we deliver the
features, performance, cost effectiveness and AI readiness they need; all in one platform. As we look ahead, we
remain confident in MongoDB's position to lead both the current wave of digital transformation and the next wave
powered by AI.
With that, here's Mike.

Michael J. Berry
Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
Thanks, Dev. I'll begin with a detailed review of our second quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the
third quarter and fiscal year 2026. I will be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted.
As Dev mentioned, we had a great quarter as we exceeded all of our guidance ranges and are increasing our full
year guidance across the board. Now, on to the results.
In the second quarter, total revenue was $591 million, up 24% year-over-year and above the high end of our
guidance. Shifting to our product mix, Atlas revenue outperformed our expectations and year-over-year growth
accelerated to 29% in the quarter and now represents 74% of total revenue. This compares to 71% in the second
quarter of fiscal 2025 and 72% last quarter.
We had an impressive Atlas growth quarter, which benefited in part from the strong start to consumption in May
that we referenced on our last call as well as broad-based strength, especially in larger customers in the US. Let
me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter.

Q2 2026 Earnings Call 26-Aug-2025
In Q2, Atlas consumption growth was strong and relatively consistent with last year's growth rates. This drove the
acceleration in revenue as well as the growth in absolute revenue dollars year-to-date for the first half of fiscal
2026.
Turning to non-Atlas, revenue came in ahead of our expectations in the quarter as we continue to have success
selling incremental workloads into our existing EA customer base. Non-Atlas ARR, which reflects the underlying
revenue growth of this product line without the impact of changes in duration, grew 7% year-over-year.
In addition to the good underlying trends in non-Atlas, in Q2, we also benefited from more multi-year deals than
expected, reflecting our customers' desire to commit to building with MongoDB long-term. Approximately half of
the non-Atlas revenue outperformance versus guidance was attributable to multi-year outperformance.
We had another strong quarter for customer adds in the second quarter as we grew our customer base by
approximately 2,800 sequentially, bringing the total customer count to 59,900, which is up from over 50,700 in the
year-ago period. This quarter, we incorporated new customers added from the Voyage AI acquisition to our
customer count, representing 300 of the 2,800 added. The growth in our total customer count is being driven
primarily by Atlas, which had over 58,300 customers at the end of the quarter, compared to over 49,200 in the
year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to
MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers deploying workloads on Atlas for the first time.
Of our total customer count, over 7,300 are direct sales customers, a decline of 200 customers sequentially and
flat year-over-year. These metrics are largely due to our decision to reallocate a portion of our go-to-market
resources from the mid-market to the enterprise channel starting in the second half of last year. This does not
impact our total customer count, but is an output of fewer self-serve originated customers being elevated to our
direct sales team as we move upmarket.
In Q2, our total company net ARR expansion rate was approximately 119%, which is consistent with recent
quarters. We ended the quarter with 2,564 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR, representing 17% growth
versus the year-ago period.
Moving down the income statement, gross profit in the second quarter was $436 million, representing a gross
margin of 74%, which is down from 75% in the year-ago period. Our year-over-year gross margin decline is
primarily driven by Atlas growing as a percent of the overall business. Our income from operations was $87
million for a 15% operating margin, compared to 11% in the year-ago period. We are very pleased with our
stronger-than-expected margin result – operating margin results, which benefited mainly from our revenue
outperformance.
Additionally, I'd like to provide a little context on the modest restructuring we undertook in the quarter. It impacted
less than 2% of employees and resulted in approximately $5 million of onetime charges, which we have excluded
from our non-GAAP financials. This action is consistent with the key priorities I outlined for you last quarter to
identify ways to both reallocate existing spend to higher-ROI opportunities and be more disciplined about
incremental spending. We are focused on running an efficient, scalable business that supports growth in revenue
and profitability to drive long-term shareholder value.
Net income in the second quarter was $87 million, or $1 per share, based on 87 million diluted shares
outstanding. This compares to a net income of $59 million, or $0.70 per share, on 84 million diluted shares
outstanding in the year-ago period.

Q2 2026 Earnings Call 26-Aug-2025
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the second quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash
equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. During the quarter, we spent $200 million to repurchase
approximately 930,000 shares, which was under our previously announced $1 billion total share repurchase
authorization. Operating cash flow was well above our expectations at $72 million, and free cash flow was $70
million, which compares to negative $1 million and negative $4 million respectively in the year-ago period. Our
strong cash flow results were driven primarily by strong operating profit and higher cash collections.
Before turning to our outlook in greater detail, I'd like to share the key points driving how we are looking at the rest
of fiscal year 2026. Number one, we are raising our expectations for revenue based on our confidence in Atlas, as
well as a strong performance in the first half of the year, providing a higher starting point for Atlas heading into the
second half. Number two, we are increasing our operating margin guidance by 150 basis points at the high end,
reflecting our strong Q2 performance and continued focus on margin improvement. And number three, we are
raising our operating margin guidance while still continuing to make incremental investments for growth with a
focus on R&D and developer awareness.
Now, moving on to our full-year guidance. I'd like to provide some incremental comments on our expectations.
First, as we discussed, we had a strong start to the year and are confident in our ability to drive continued
revenue and profitability growth. We are raising our full-year revenue guidance by $70 million, including the $38-
million outperformance in Q2. This reflects the strong Q2 consumption benefiting revenue in the second half and
our continued confidence in Atlas growth. All in, this implies mid-20s percentage growth for Atlas in the second
half of the year.
Second, incorporating our strong performance in the first half, we expect non-Atlas subscription revenue will now
be down in the mid-single-digits for the year compared to our prior expectation of high-single-digit decline. We
also expect the headwind from multi-year license revenue for fiscal 2026 to now be $40 million due to the Q2
outperformance compared to our prior expectation of approximately $50 million. Please note we expect non-Atlas
ARR will continue to grow year-over-year.
Finally, we are raising our expectations for operating margin to 14% at the high end, up from 12.5% in our prior
quarter guidance. This reflects the better-than-expected revenue performance, the impact of our more disciplined
approach to investing for growth, and our increased focus on efficiency.
For fiscal year 2026, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $2.34 billion to $2.36 billion, an increase of $70
million from our prior guide. We are raising our non-GAAP income from operations expectations by $44 million
and are now targeting a range of $321 million to $331 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the
range of $3.64 to $3.73 based on 87.4 million diluted shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per
share guidance for the third quarter and fiscal year 2026 assumes a non-GAAP tax provision of 20%.
Moving on to our Q3 guidance, a few things to keep in mind. First, we expect to see a low 20% year-over-year
percentage decline in the non-Atlas business after the strong multi-year outperformance we experienced in Q3 of
fiscal year 2025. As a reminder, Q3 of last year was our strongest multi-year revenue quarter and is the largest
portion of the multi-year headwind. Second, we expect operating margin will be lower than in Q2, primarily due to
the expected sequential decline in non-Atlas revenue, which is very high-margin revenue. In addition, it is also
impacted by the timing of operating expenses, specifically R&D hiring and seasonality of our marketing
investments.

Q2 2026 Earnings Call 26-Aug-2025
With that context, I will now turn to our outlook for the third quarter. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be
in the range of $587 million to $592 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of
$66 million to $70 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.79 based on 87.7
million diluted shares outstanding.
To summarize, we had a very strong quarter. We are pleased with our ability to drive revenue growth across the
business and increase our operating profit expectations. We remain incredibly excited about the opportunity
ahead and we'll continue to invest responsibly to drive long-term shareholder value.
I would also like to take a moment to extend a warm welcome to Jess Lubert, our new Vice President of Investor
Relations, who started with us yesterday. Jess joins us from Juniper Networks, where he led their investor
relations effort, including the most recent – including most recently helping the company navigate the acquisition
by Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. We're excited to have him onboard and eager to see the impact of his work.
Last but not least, we look forward to seeing many of you in a few weeks at our Investor Day. Please reach out to
our Investor Relations team at ir@mongodb.com with any questions.
With that, we'd like to open it up for questions. Carmen, take it away.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Sanjit Singh with Morgan
Stanley. Please proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjit K. Singh Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Thank you for taking the question and congrats on a heck of a quarter in Q2. I wanted to dive into some of the
drivers into Q2. When I look at the acceleration Atlas, which has now accelerated for two quarters in a row, and I
kind of just look at the sequential dollar adds, I have that up more than $40 million in Q2, which is kind of the
strongest sequential dollar adds we've seen in quite some time in what's been a pretty sober sort of cloud
spending environment.
So, I was wondering if you could give us some sense of the drivers of the strong sequential adds this quarter. I
know you pointed to May, but if anything you can give us from like a workload perspective or any other new
factors, maybe the workloads from last year starting to ramp. I'd just love to understand that trajectory a little bit
better.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. Sanjit, thank you. Thanks for the question. So, clearly, we're really pleased by the quarter and really
pleased by the accelerating growth in Atlas. I would say, a lot of it was due to the workloads that we acquired over
the past year, especially with our move up market that are growing faster and becoming bigger than previous
workloads we've seen. So, I think the move up market is really paying off.
And what we're also seeing is that there's a great uptick of some of the other capabilities we offer like Search and
Vector Search that are also adding to that growth of those workloads. And then, as we mentioned, we also

acquired a ton of new customers. Obviously, the self-serve customers tend to spend less on a per-customer
basis, but we also have added lots of customers over the last six months, and I think that's also helping drive
some of the growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjit K. Singh Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah, that's great color. I wanted to follow up on the go-to-market side. Over the last couple of years, we've been
sort of tinkering and optimizing the go-to-market organization across sort of territory investment, but also sort of
quotas and moving to incremental consumption. Could you give us an update on the state of operations for the
sales force today? And in some sense, if I look at the customer adds, it seems like things are humming quite well.
But just to better understand how – like what's the state of the organization today, that'd be really helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah, sure. So, nothing really has changed. We're just doubling down on what we've said previously. We are
moving up markets. We're focusing our high-end sales force focused on the most sophisticated and demanding
customers. These are typically enterprise customers all around the world.
And then, we're using our self-serve channel to better serve the SMB market. I know there are lot of questions
about where we kind of abandoning the self-serve – the early stage market by this move, and I think the results
over the last couple quarters have shown that we are not. I think we're just becoming much more effective in
serving that market while also being very effective in growing our wallet share in these larger accounts. So, we're
really just continuing with the strategy that we articulated before, and obviously, we're pleased with the results.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Raimo Lenschow Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Perfect. Thank you. First of all, congrats to Jess. All the best. Two quick questions from me. Staying on that
theme of self-service, that acceleration, Dev, obviously, you changed things around, but it kind of accelerated
despite kind of you actually moving up market. Like can you help us understand then what's driving that a little
bit? And then I had one follow-up for Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, clearly, the output metrics look really good, but I would say the work around self-serve began – has
been going on for a while. The team is really good at running experiments using a data-driven approach to figure
out what's working, to figure out what's not working.

A new motion that we're also doing that's showing good results is going after SQL developers who don't really
know MongoDB and attracting them to our platform, really helping them understand the value proposition of
MongoDB, even running things like Office Hours, where we spend time with SQL developers to explain the
benefits of modeling data on a document database.
And all these experiments and tactics that we're doing, which are very data-driven, are really paying off. And May
Petry used to run that group, is now our CMO, and she has a strong team under her and we feel really good
about what that self-serve team has been doing. But again, we don't want to declare victory too early, but
obviously, we're very pleased with the results.

Raimo Lenschow Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah. No, that's really nice to see. And then, Mike, the – thanks, first of all, for all the extra disclosure, the ARR for
further non-Atlas or EA part is kind of really helpful. If you think about the – I guess, in logic around the renewal
cohorts, especially Q3, but – and am I doing the math correctly that actually, next year, that part of the business
looks more interesting because the cohort looks better? Like just trying to get your idea and maybe you might not
even give it to us because you just do ARR. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Berry A
Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
Sure. So, thanks for the question. So, I'm going to hold that answer till we get to Q3 of next year, because it kind
of depends on what happens in Q3 of this year. So, the one thing is, as we talked about the big impact in Q3 of
this year is the multi-year. We'll see how it comes back next year but it really depends, Raimo, on how we do in
Q3 this year.

Tyler Radke Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hey, thanks for taking the question and nice job on the Atlas growth. Wanted to dig into the AI commentary that
you had, Dev. Obviously, last quarter you talked about Cursor, which obviously is ramping up significantly in
terms of their ARR. And I think you called out many examples this quarter, including a autonomous vehicle
company, sounds like expecting pretty significant growth there.

But how much of that is playing into the Atlas strength that you're seeing here in the quarter? Any way to quantify
that cohort or use cases, whether it's Vector Search or maybe even if you throw in Voyage? Just help us
understand if that's starting to move the needle, because it sounds like there's some pretty high-profile wins in
there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. So, thanks for the question, Tyler. While we're adding thousands of AI-native customers, I would tell you
that the growth that we delivered this quarter was not material to that growth. The growth was really driven by our
core business and our core customer base. And so – and while we're very happy with the AI customers
increasingly choosing MongoDB, it was not a material – a mover of the needle for our growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tyler Radke Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Great. And then follow-up on the migration opportunity. I know you've been investing in Relational Migrator.
You're working with companies like Cognition to accelerate the code migration opportunity and you've seen
professional services ramp up a little bit. But where – have you started to see sort of the time to migration or re-
platform improve a bit? Just anything you could share in terms of that migration opportunity, if that's started to
improve in terms of velocity or size of workload migration would be helpful. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. So, yes, we're super excited about what we call app monetization or legacy app monetization. You'll
hear a lot more about this at Investor Day in September, Tyler. But what I will say to you is that the value
proposition is very clear. Customers are very, very motivated to try and modernize these legacy systems for a
wide variety of reasons.
We are seeing a lot of progress. We've actually brought in a new leader, new product leader who brings a lot of
depth and scale, especially around AI, to help us build the tooling to leverage AI to really drive more automation in
terms of how we analyze and refactor the code. We brought in a new leader last quarter to help, really help drive
the delivery and the go-to-market efforts around app mod.
So, we're definitely beefing up resources and I would say that we're investing a lot in product and there's a lot
more to do. And I would say this is something that we're very excited about, but it'll drive more of our longer-term
growth, less – it won't be as pronounced in terms of this year, but we're very, very excited about the opportunity
and we're definitely – we'll spend more time discussing this and what we're actually doing on the product side in
September.

Q2 2026 Earnings Call 26-Aug-2025
Jason Ader Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Yeah, thank you. Dev, I was hoping you could talk about some of the kind of latest industry developments just on
the technology side, in particular I'm thinking about Lakebase from Databricks and then DocumentDB in the Linux
Foundation. Can you just comment on both those things and how they might impact MongoDB and how you
differentiate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. So, let me tackle them one by one. Clearly, what we are seeing is that the strategic high ground for AI,
especially when it comes to inference, is OLTP. So, we talked about this on the last call where some companies
that acquired early-stage OLTP start-ups. And what it really spoke to, and those companies had spoken about
their organic efforts to build an OLTP platform, and I think what it spoke to was the fact that they building an OLTP
platform that's ready and mission-critical and enterprise can serve the most demanding requirements of
enterprises is not trivial. And I think they basically threw in the towel and decided to do these acquisitions.
And what it just reinforces that OLTP is the strategic high ground for AI. And we believe that if, now, customers
are going to be choosing what OLTP platform that they want for AI, just given our architecture, just given the fact
that we have a durable architectural advantage in terms of JSON support, which addresses messy, complicated,
and highly interdependent and constantly changing data structures. The fact that we integrated Search and
Vector Search I think really helps us position going after AI.
With regards to your second question around the Linux Foundation, I think what this really also suggests – shows
is that real JSON is much more important now with AI than ever before and the clones and bolt-ons and – that
have traded off features and performance and developer experience have just not met customer expectations.
And candidly, what I see this is that the hyperscalers are investing less and really handing off to the open-source
community to kind of really take on the bulk of the work in terms of product development. Our hyperscaler
partnerships remain strong and I think we have the right open-source model where we can balance the access to
free software while preserving the ability to both generate and capture value.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Ader Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. And then just one quick follow-up. Why do we hear so much about Postgres adoption for AI
start-ups? You talked about the success you guys are having, but if Postgres has the disadvantages that you've
talked about, multiple times, scalability, JSON support, how come we hear so much about that, kind of at least in
the early stages of AI?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. That's a good – that's a really good question, and I think it's important to understand. And we spend a lot of
time, we have now invested in the team in the Bay Area that spends a lot of time with the start-up community.
What's become clear is a lot of these start-up founders don't think that hard about their database choice. They
kind of go with what they know.
And what we are seeing is that as some of these start-ups are scaling, they're running into real scaling challenges
with Postgres. And what – and we've talked about in the past, like when you add a JSON, when you use JSONB

on Postgres, a 2-kilobyte document or bigger starts really creating performance problems because Postgres has
to do something called off-road storage, which creates enormous performance overheads.
And so, the developers need a platform that can handle structured, semi-structured, unstructured data. They need
obviously a platform that performs well, and they need a platform that can scale as they grow. And what we're
hearing clearly from the start-up communities that Postgres in many cases is not scaling for them and they're now
coming to us.
And so, we feel really good about our position. But the reality is that a lot of these AI founders kind of start with
what they know or what they've used in the past, and only when the business starts scaling do they start
recognizing the challenges. And we realize we need to do more developer education and do more work, and so
we're investing a lot in the start-up community. We're running a big event in October in San Francisco with a big
hackathon and we're inviting a lot of customers to participate. But that's just the start of a meaningful investment
we're making in the Bay Area and the AI start-up community to rethink their decisions around just going with what
they know.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Cikos Q
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC
Hey, thanks for taking the questions, guys. I just wanted to come back to Atlas specifically. And, Mike, appreciate
last quarter you gave us some very granular color around the Atlas trends. Was hoping to get an update on how
Atlas trends played out this quarter or just at the very least, why we did see such broad-based strength from large
customers this quarter. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Berry A
Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
Sure. Thanks for the question, Mike. So, when we talk about consumption in the second quarter for Atlas, as we
talked about, it performed well, grew 29% year-over-year. As we talked about, Mike, the consumption growth
were relatively consistent with last year. And as we talked about on the last call, we started out with a strong May
and we saw broad-based strength across most of the geos and segments, so nothing to call out there, but we did
see notable strength in the larger customers in the US.
And if we dive deeper on that one, as Dev talked about, we are seeing some workloads from our larger customers
grow for longer and expand more than we have – we've seen in the past. So, that's good. While there's many
moving parts in the consumption business, we also expect that there is benefit from our go-to-market changes,
and given the preponderance of our strategic accounts being in the US, no surprise that we saw that growth
mostly in the US. And then lastly, Mike, there is some benefit from comparing it to a little slower growth in Q1. So,
that would be the detail on Q2 as it relates to consumption growth.

Thank you for that. And if I could just squeeze maybe one more in, on the outperformance that we saw this
quarter from the multi-year deals, and maybe I'm just misunderstanding here, but my assumption was the reason
we were facing this outperformance was really tied to the fact that in prior years had some pretty big deals on the
multi-year front. And so, to see some of these deals come in this year, is that a function of customers renewing
earlier, which is helping fill that larger divot that we previously expected? Is that a fair assumption or can you help
me think through that a little bit more? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Berry A
Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
So, thanks for the golf analogy. No, it did not fill the divot. So, in Q2, it was really – it was good underlying
strength in ARR growth and then greater-than-expected multi-year. There were really no pull-forwards, Mike, and
this is a hard business to forecast because sometimes even customers don't know whether they're going up for
an annual renewal or a multi-year.
So, it was – there were no pull-forwards and there was nothing out of the ordinary. Very importantly, we left the
non-Atlas assumptions consistent with our last guidance, hence pulling down the multi-year headwind from $50
million to $40 million. And again, nothing to call out on Q2, no pull-forwards and there were really no large multi-
years in there. It was just across a good subset of customers.

Alex Zukin Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in and I'll echo the congrats on a truly amazing quarter. I guess, Dev, when
you think about the AI comments that you've talked about both in the press release and in the call, maybe just a
little bit more nuance in the use cases, not necessarily that you're seeing kind of contribute materially today, but
the differentiation of the platform that you're able to incrementally take market share as it becomes available, both
in net new kind of AI-native companies, but also in some of your larger existing companies or customers that are
starting to modernize for this kind of conversational or AI-native era.
Where are you seeing the most momentum in terms of the workload construction and scale? And when do you
think we should expect to kind of actually start seeing that contribute more materially to the growth in
consumption?

Q2 2026 Earnings Call 26-Aug-2025
Yeah. So, thanks for the question, Alex. A couple points. Again, we're very pleased with the results of this quarter,
but I would say the AI cohort was not a material driver of the growth. That being said, what we are seeing is a lot
of customers very, very interested in our architecture. Let me again walk through why.
One, we're a JSON database. JSON is the best way to express and model the complicated and messy and highly
interdependent and constantly evolving data structures that you have to deal with in the real world. So, that's point
number one. So, it's much easier to do that in MongoDB than to do that on some [indiscernible] (00:40:27) kind of
set-up on top of relational database.
Second is that we integrate Search and Vector Search, so you can do very sophisticated things to what people
call hybrid search and retrieval, you can do very sophisticated things and finding information quickly, which is a
very unique differentiator for us. So, what this means that rather than stitching together multiple systems, you can
do this all on MongoDB so it becomes less complexity and lower cost.
The third thing is that we've now embedded voice models on our platform, right? So, the – if you control the
embedding layer, you sit at the gateway of meeting of AI, right? What the embedding models do is really our
bridge between a company's private data and the LLM. So, that becomes really important because the better the
quality of the embedding model, the better the quality of the signal of your own data. So, that reduces things like
hallucinations or just bad outputs.
And so, customers are now, as people start caring more and more about like higher-stake use cases, they really
want to ensure the outputs are high. And the fact that as part of our platform, we can enable you to do auto
embeddings, it becomes an incredibly compelling feature.
In terms of the market, what I would say is that the enterprise uptake of AI is still early. I've said this for a couple
of years now and I think a lot of people were a little skeptical of what I said, but it's proving to be true. As we
predicted, like the lack of skills and the lack of trust with AI systems is kind of slowing. People have been very
cautious about deploying AI. Where it is being deployed is really on end user productivity, whether it's developers
with cogen tools or business users using tools to summarize documents, extract data or things like deflecting
tickets from people to systems with like conversational AI.
I think you are starting to see the first steps in people deploying agent-based systems, and I can talk a little bit
about that, but that's still very, very early. We're seeing small ISVs. Some of them are taking off who are really
driving most of the impact, but the real enduring value will come. When you talk to a customer today, most of
them, when you ask them is AI really transforming your business, they'll say no. Yes, we're seeing some
productivity gains here and there, but it's not really transforming my business.
I think the real enduring value will come when they build custom AI solutions that truly transform their business,
whether to drive new revenue opportunities or dramatically reduce their existing cost structure. But we're really
pleased. I mentioned this electric car company that's very tech-savvy that's using MongoDB. I should mention one
of the fastest growing startups in the Bay Area has bet big on MongoDB. DevRev, the company going after the
helpdesk space, has built their own agentic platform on MongoDB. So, we feel really good about what this all
portends for the future. But as I said, it was a small part of our growth this quarter.

Very helpful. And then maybe if I could just sneak one in for Mike. You've been kind of saying from I think the first
day you started about how the margin profile of this business, it's not an or; it's an and. And it's clearly coming
through in both the growth acceleration, but also the meaningful margin outperformance.
As you think about sustaining this kind of accelerating pace and investing in things like the Bay Area startup
community, how are you finding that balance, that and versus or balance that, quite frankly, is elusive to a lot of
companies that are doing what you guys are doing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Berry A
Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
Well, I think that's the funnest part of my job, quite frankly. So, I would give kudos to not only the management
team, but everybody at MongoDB to really jump in this. I think that this has been a company-wide effort. And as
we look forward and as we talked about, Alex, the number one driver of margin expansion for Mongo is the
revenue growth. So, those two are directly connected. It's a great business model when we can grow Atlas in the
20%-plus range and then keep that ARR or VA in that single-digit. It generates a ton of gross profit that funds a
lot.
And the team has done a really – has done a great job of making sure that we are investing in growth, that we go
back and look at what we're doing, making sure that it's driving growth. If it's not, then we have an open
discussion about whether we should reallocate. So, I felt good about it when I started. Candidly, I feel better about
it 90 days later.

Kash Rangan Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
It's always tough to go after Alex because he asked such good questions, but that's not going to stop me. So, Dev
and Mike, congratulations on the quarter. It's super interesting. You were talking about how some of the Silicon
Valley AI startup founders don't have time to think about databases, but our good friend, Dheeraj, at DevRev
seems to have made a wise choice here.
So, as you set encampment up in the Bay Area and start to evangelize the need for an Atlas consumption, AI-
savvy database, how do you reconcile type of the fact at the same time enterprise is where you really saw the
bread and butter value proposition of Mongo resonates?

So, could what is happening with DevRev be a leading indication of what's going to happen in the enterprise?
Because we've all, much to your observation, not seen much of a productivity impact in the enterprise because of
AI at the business level. And so, what could be that unlock? What are folks like Dheeraj doing correctly that is a –
could be a precursor if it is for what is to come in the enterprise?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. So, Kash, thanks for the question. Obviously, I have so much respect for Dheeraj. He built Nutanix into a
real great business and he's going to do the same at DevRev. I will tell you that the AI cohort, as I said earlier,
was not really material to our growth. So, I think these are all customers kind of earlier in their journey.
So, what we are seeing what's driving the growth right now is these large enterprises with workloads that we
acquired both last year and this year that are really driving the growth, especially the Atlas growth that we saw
this quarter. And what that really confirms is that our move upmarket made sense. The quality of those workloads,
the durability of that growth, they become – grow for longer and become bigger than what we've seen in the past
is really making us feel good about that decision.
And to juxtapose that, we also obviously decided to double down on self-serve to better serve the small- and
medium-sized business market. And that's also become – obviously, becoming more and more effective and gets
us given the number of customers that we've added over the last six months. So, we feel like those motions are
working well in concert together, and we feel like this allows us to be much more efficient about how we go to
market.
And it's also going to be continuing more work to – continue to drive that efficiency even better, but we also are
investing for the long term. And so, we're just constantly debating those decisions internally, but we feel good
about what's working. And we feel good that like someone like Dheeraj is betting early on MongoDB because
that's a good signal for other founders who are thinking about doing the same.

Q2 2026 Earnings Call 26-Aug-2025
Clearly, EA is a large enterprise motion and what we have seen is that it's typically less new customers choose
EA and it's more of our existing customer base who have a mix of EA and then sometimes they then also start
deploying Atlas. I think one thing that's becoming more and more clear is that, customers are becoming much
more thoughtful about like how they think about using deployments on-premise versus using the cloud.
I think four, five years ago, there's a belief that everything was going to move to the cloud. I think large enterprises
have become much more sophisticated and nuanced in their thinking, and they believe that some workloads
make sense to run on-prem and some workloads make sense to run in the cloud. And I think that's where the
MongoDB story becomes really attractive because the same code base can be used.
And so, it also gives them optionality for the future where they can move from on-prem to the cloud. And a lot of
our EA customers have done that either with new workloads and some existing workloads, and then they can also
move from cloud to cloud. And they can also move back to on-prem if they choose to do so. So, that optionality
becomes a very powerful value proposition for our customers.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ittai Kidron Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Thanks and great numbers and congrats to Jess and good luck in the new role. Dev, I wanted to dig into the AI
opportunity again, but take it from a perspective of a go-to-market motion. Clearly, you can power a lot of AI use
cases that are embedded with bigger platforms through a self-serve motion, but it sounds like to really capture the
big workload opportunity is it's going to have to be more of an enterprise push.
So, I'm kind of wondering. How do you think about targeting the AI opportunity from go-to-market motion? That
doesn't just fall into if you're a big enterprise, I'm going to send you to an enterprise salesperson and all the rest
call our self-serve and do-it-yourself. Is it something a little bit more, you think, a target perhaps that you need to
take here in order to capitalize on this opportunity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. What I would say, Ittai, is that we've seen this movie before with the cloud where some early stage
customers started growing very, very quickly and then we then put dedicated sales focus on those accounts and
they grew then even faster. So, we're clearly watching the market and when self-serve customers are to a point
where they really need a higher touch kind of engagement model, then we're more than happy to do that.
And we have a team that kind of helps transition customers from self-serve to more of a direct sales approach
and that has worked for us. I think what we learned is that that line by which we actually engage a high touch

model can move higher because we've become so sophisticated with self-serve that we can really serve
customers for – early stage customers for a long period of time.
In terms of the enterprise, what I would say is what I've said earlier is that the enterprise is still quite early in their
journey to AI. Most of the investments right now are more on end user productivity like developers using cogen
tools and what I call low stakes use cases.
In fact, I had two meetings today with two different leaders of two different financial institutions here in New York
and they both talked about what they're doing in AI. They both admitted that they've kind of started with low
stakes use cases, but their appetite to start doing more is increasing as they get more and more comfortable with
the technology and they're quite excited to leverage MongoDB as part of that journey.
But again, I think that's kind of a microcosm into the enterprise market where I think they're still quite early in their
AI journey. And if you remember, this is something I've been saying for a while that most customers, most people
overestimate the impact of a new technology like AI in the short-term, but underestimate the long-term. And I think
we're just in that classic journey right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ittai Kidron Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Appreciate that. And maybe as a follow-up, Mike, I just want to make sure I dig in a little bit into the non-Atlas
business, the EA, predominantly EA business. Can you tell us roughly what percent of your customers here are in
multi-year deals versus just annual deals? I'm just kind of curious how – where we are now and what was it, say,
a year or two ago and where do you think that mix is going to be a year or two from now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Berry A
Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah, thanks for the question. We don't break out the percentage of customers on multi-year versus one year.
What I would say is in fiscal 2025, obviously we saw a lot of larger multi-year deals and you see that in the
numbers this year. We will always see multi-year deals. They haven't been, I would call it, as large. So, it's more
widespread.
So, that's really the change that we've seen. We haven't broken that out. I don't think that it has changed much,
especially over the year, as Dev talked about. It's going to be a mix of Atlas and on-prem. And that mix has stayed
relatively consistent.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ittai Kidron Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
When you look at the customers that are choosing multi-year deals, has anything changed in the way they think
about the reasoning behind doing that versus not?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Berry A
Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
No. Reasons are the same. It's typically they're – if it aligns with their long-term strategy, they want to be able to
lock in the pricing and as everybody knows, hey, data has gravity. Moving data around is not fun for everybody.
So, they want to be able to lock in and guarantee their prices for that period of time.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Please proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Siti Panigrahi Q
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC
Thanks for taking my question and Dev, I think some of the comments you're talking about AI slowdown and you
heard about recent MIT report about 95% AI implementation not getting any kind of return. How do you see –
what's kind of, do you think, the inflection point? When do we think we'll start seeing some of the adoption of this
AI? Like you said, they are testing, but what can trigger – I know you have been talking about a year ago probably
we are few years out, but it's good to see some of the traction. So, how do you, first of all – what would be your
view on that report and how should we think about the – in terms of revenue contribution, material contribution
from AI?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. So, I think it just comes down to the fundamental principles. I think customers need to feel, one, that the
quality of the output of these AI systems is high. Obviously, AI systems are probabilistic in nature, not
deterministic in nature. So, you can always guarantee the output. You can hope that you've trained the models
well. You hope that you've given it the right information, but you can't always guarantee the output.
So, as mentioned, I had meetings with two financial services customers earlier today and both of them are still
hesitant to roll out end user-facing AI applications for those specific reasons. It's going to take a little bit of time for
people to really get comfortable that they can really deal with the last mile issues and make sure that they don't
have any errors that potentially could be impacting their brand or really cause a lot of customer problems. So,
that's point number one.
Then there's issues around obviously the security of these systems, the stability and reliability of these systems,
the scalability of these systems that I mentioned. Some of these early stage companies are running into scaling
issues with existing architecture, which is why they're coming to us. So, I think we're just in that learning journey. I
mean, I don't know if there's going to be some massive tipping point. I think what we are seeing with the frontier
models is that all these frontier models are kind of clustering around the same ballpark in terms of performance
and the efficacy of their models.
So, I think what's going to start happening is how people start leveraging these insights to build what I call a
scaffolding around these frontier models to address the needs of their business. Obviously, everyone's talking
about agents and people are very, very focused on essentially using agents to drive a lot of work. Agents require
– if you think about if you're using agents, agents will use your systems much more intensely than humans will
because they can do things much more quickly. So, you need platforms that can massively scale up and down,
which is again a good sign and support indicator for MongoDB.

Q2 2026 Earnings Call 26-Aug-2025
So, I think it's going to take a little bit of time. It's going to take time to be comfortable with technology. It's going to
take time where people start with low stakes use cases start gravitating to higher stake use cases. So, I don't
think that's going to be some seminal inflection point. I think it's just going to take time, but I think that time is
coming.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Sills Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Oh, great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask about some of the investments that you alluded to earlier that
you're making in R&D. How are you thinking about that? Is that incremental investments in some of these newer
offerings like Vector and streaming? Are there new workloads that you're thinking of addressing here? Would love
to get some color on just where you're investing in the stack. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah, sure. So, we talked about the fact that R&D is a big part of our investment focus for this year. One, we
came out with 8.0, which is the most performant release ever. So, we are already starting to see dividends of our
investments in our platform. 8.1 is even better and then we're also making investments in the expansion parts of
our platform.
What I will say is we're going to go into a lot more detail around this Investor Day. So, if you can hold until
September 17, we'll go into a lot of things that we're doing on the R&D side as well as what we're doing on
application and monetization and the tooling that we're building there that will really speak to those investments
we're making and we'll give you a lot more color.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Sills Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. Great. Thanks for that, Dev, and one more, if I may, please. I know there's been an effort to focus on
driving higher quality workloads in that larger account base. I mean, to what extent would you attribute some of
this upside to that effort? And maybe just an update on that effort as you [indiscernible] (00:59:23).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
I would attribute a lot to that effort. I would say a big part of this growth is the fact that we're acquiring higher
quality workloads that are growing faster and for longer than the workloads required, say, in earlier years. And I
think that's a big part for why you're seeing this growth happen now.

Operator: All right. One moment, please, and we have the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC. Please proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rishi Jaluria Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Oh, wonderful. Thanks for squeezing me in at the deadline. I'll keep myself to one question. Dev, really nice to
see the early traction with AI-native companies. It's always made sense to us, especially given your scalability and
your ability to work with unstructured data. If we were to fast-forward 5, 10 years and we start to see a real
paradigm shift where instead of agents built on kind of the traditional GUI mobile interface that we've been in for
the past 30 years, we actually enter kind of a multi- agentic world where maybe the interaction vector may move
away from what we've been used to into more natural language, can you talk about why MongoDB still has a
strong role and some of the investments that you might be making to position yourself well for that world,
understanding that's, at the very least, several years away? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah, sure. So, again, just to make sure we're all talking at the same language, we believe that agents essentially
do three things. One, they perceive or understand the state of things. So, you need essentially a way to
understand the state of what's happening in your business. Then you need to decide what to do or plan. So,
basically you have to come up with a plan saying I want to take this action or these sets of actions, and then you
have to act. You actually have to go execute those actions, right?
So, why is MongoDB good for agents? One is, as I said before, the JSON document database is the best at being
able to model the real world, the messiness, the complicated nature. The real world does not fit easily in rows and
columns and that's why our document database, I think, is the best way to do that.
Two, we obviously support Search and Vector Search. So, you can do a very sophisticated hybrid search. So,
that becomes super important and then with memory, if agents didn't have memory, they will act like goldfish.
They could only react to the last thing or last piece of information that they saw. So, memory lets agents connect
the dots across time and situation.
So, you have different kinds of memory, things like short-term context, past experiences, knowledge, skills, et
cetera, that you could build share quickly. You need to be able to orchestrate those agents because you may
have multiple agents doing a certain task. You need to register and have governance policies around those
agents.
We think that the underlying platform needs to be able to support those things. While there's a lot more work
needs to be done, the underlying architecture that we have in MongoDB is well-suited to address those needs
and we think that will be positioned to be a winner as people deploy more and more agents in their enterprise.

Good afternoon and welcome to Teradata's 2025 third quarter earnings call. Steve McMillan, Teradata's President
and Chief Executive Officer, will lead our call today; followed by John Ederer, Teradata's Chief Financial Officer,
who will discuss our financial results and outlook.
Our discussion today includes forecasts and other information that are considered forward-looking statements.
While these statements reflect our current outlook, they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that
could cause actual results to differ materially. These risk factors are described in today's earnings release and in
our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K and in the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30,
2025 that is expected to be filed with the SEC within the next few days. These forward-looking statements are
made as of today and we undertake no duty or obligation to update them.
On today's call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures which exclude such items as stock-
based compensation expense and other special items described in our earnings release. We will also discuss
other non-GAAP items such as free cash flow, constant currency comparisons and 2025 revenue and ARR
growth outlook in constant currency.
Unless stated otherwise all numbers and results discussed on today's call are on a non-GAAP basis. A
reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in our earnings release, which is accessible on the
Investor Relations page of our website at investor.teradata.com. A replay of this conference call will be available
later today on our website.
And now I will turn the call over to Steve.

Thanks, Chad, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Q3 marked another quarter of solid execution as we
beat our revenue and recurring revenue guidance ranges. We delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.72
soundly ahead of our outlook and we delivered free cash flow ahead of expectations. We posted our second
consecutive quarter of total ARR growth ahead of our initial target of the fourth quarter. With a return to total ARR
growth ahead of schedule, we have strong conviction in our durable growth path and expect this growth to
continue in 2026. We also expect that the return to positive ARR growth combined with the cost savings and
productivity measures we've taken will result in meaningful free cash flow growth.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 04-Nov-2025
Whether in cloud or on-prem, we are helping organizations build the data foundation and are delivering the
enterprise context required for AI solutions. And we see the shift in our business from classic EDW towards the
autonomous AI and knowledge platform. We see enterprises re-evaluating how to cost effectively deploy Agentic
AI.
As we have noted for the past several quarters, we are seeing a resurgence of hybrid environments, which
reflects a growing understanding of how enterprises can best leverage both on-prem and cloud capabilities. It isn't
just about choosing between environments anymore. It's about effectively operating across both to meet diverse
business needs. Our platform is designed to give customers the opportunity to run Agentic AI at scale wherever
that data resides in their business, in public cloud, on-prem or private cloud.
Interest in AI, and in particular, Agentic AI continues to grow in virtually all industries. However, most companies
are still in the early stages of deploying this technology, and Teradata fits squarely at the center of this revolution.
We believe we provide the enterprise context that AI agents need to deliver trusted, reliable results at scale.
Without this knowledge, even the most advanced models can be just plain wrong.
This shift also creates a very specific opportunity because Agentic AI with its 24/7 always-on query potential can
increase workloads on data platforms by up to 25 times and use 50 to 100 times the compute resources than
what was required by previous modern analytic workloads. Teradata is uniquely built to handle these mixed
workloads and high volumes of tactical queries. As enterprises deploy potentially thousands of agents and
evaluate millions of relationships across thousands of tables to make a single decision, milliseconds matter. We
not only manage the critical enterprise data that powers these AI systems, but we also can deliver the
performance required at the level of performance and scale that AI needs.
Teradata was built for these types of enormous workloads based on our massively parallel architecture, patented
workload management and query optimization that is designed to provide a high-performance environment with
predictable costs that can deliver the most complex AI workloads. Our patented QueryGrid data analytics fabric
provides seamless, high-performing data access, processing and movement across multiple data sources. Our
industry data models are built on decades of working with the Global 1000. And through these, we bring deep
context to language models another area where we can bring unique benefits to our customers. We believe
Teradata is the best autonomous AI and knowledge platform for agentic workloads, and that our platform provides
the best price performance, whether on-prem or in the cloud.
In the quarter, we were named a leader in the Forrester Wave Data Management for Analytics Platforms, and the
report noted that Teradata is a good choice for organizations seeking to support hybrid cloud DMA deployment,
especially where reliability, scalability and high availability are essential. We're building the capabilities for the
future to enable AI speed and scale. Earlier this year, we announced Enterprise Vector Store, a capability that
enables organizations to include unstructured data and their integrated knowledge foundation. We also enhanced
ClearScape Analytics with unified ModelOps capabilities designed specifically for Agentic AI. These provide
seamless native support for open source models as well as CSP model APIs. We launched our MCP server to
deliver faster context autonomously. And we've recently taken several more significant steps to further our
position.
In September, we announced Teradata AgentBuilder, a suite of capabilities designed to accelerate the
development and deployment of autonomous, contextually intelligent AI agents. Now in private preview, it
leverages open-source frameworks, our MCP server and deep semantic access to enterprise data across cloud
and on-prem environments provided by our knowledge platform. Customers can develop their own agents or use
ready-to-deploy Teradata agents to accelerate implementation and deliver rapid impact.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 04-Nov-2025
Launched at our Possible event last month, Autonomous Customer Intelligence is a software and services
offering that embeds Teradata agents across the customer experience, or CX, journey. These agents can
uniquely leverage four decades of Teradata innovation and contextual knowledge from solving mission-critical,
industry-specific data challenges. Our integrated approach makes sure our agents are extensions of the
enterprise data platform and broader knowledge ecosystem rather than generic tools that fail to deliver
meaningful impact.
To help customers transform AI pilots into production-ready agentic solutions that deliver significant business
value, we also launched new AI services. These new services are intended to make Agentic AI a reality at
enterprise scale by combining embedded experts, proven methodology and Teradata's best-in-class autonomous
AI and knowledge platform. Using a sprint-based use case-driven approach, Teradata AI services offer flexible
tiered offerings that meet organizations at any stage of their AI journey from initial pilots to enterprise-wide agentic
deployments.
Unlike competitors who offer either consulting or technology, we believe Teradata uniquely delivers both, enabling
real-time context-aware agent decisioning that leverages our suite of AI tools, trusted data and decades of
industry innovation. Working with our partners in an integrated approach accelerates deployment of autonomous
intelligence, CX or otherwise, to drive measurable business outcomes.
We have forward-deployed resources with deep expertise and talent. These AI/ML engineers and data scientists
are working with customers across the globe, positioning Teradata as a leading AI/ML player, and helping
customers move from proof of concepts to production. This team is on track to complete more than 150 AI
engagements with customers this year. We're also seeing a significant turn in our pipeline towards AI-fueled
projects.
Let's look at a few examples of wins from the quarter. These demonstrate the breadth of our offers in hybrid
environments, cloud and on-prem. A multinational automotive manufacturer is expanding its Teradata Cloud
platform on AWS to support increasing AI/ML workloads as it combats cybersecurity. Executing approximately 10
million SQL statements per day, the customer is moving beyond rule-based approaches and adopting AI/ML
technologies to enhance its analytical capabilities.
One of the largest US healthcare providers deepened its strategic alliance with us as it further scaled its Teradata
Cloud deployment running on Microsoft Azure. This expansion, building on momentum from earlier this year,
underscores the provider's continued confidence in our high-performance cloud platform to support mission-
critical data and analytics workloads. With this expansion, the organization is further positioned to drive
operational excellence and harness complex healthcare data at scale across its entire system.
A leading Japanese heavy industry manufacturer chose Teradata for its on-prem data platform as it transforms to
a data-driven manufacturing entity and improves operational efficiency.
A Central European financial services company recommitted to us through a seven-year partnership with
Teradata as-a-service on AWS. This enhances security, provides uninterrupted operations through disaster
recovery systems that match production, supports monthly innovation testing and meets stringent data
sovereignty requirements.
We recently held our annual customer event named Possible. It was three days of high energy with our people,
partners and customers speaking on what they are doing now with data and analytics and what they are looking

ahead to do with AI and Agentic AI. It was our pleasure to recognize VodafoneThree, Ooredoo and Sicredi at the
conference for demonstrating exceptional creativity, technical excellence and business impact through the use of
AI on the Teradata AI and knowledge platform.
VodafoneThree in the UK was recognized for deploying an AI-supported fraud detection framework. By leveraging
AI to detect and mitigate fraud, it has strengthened customer trust, improved regulatory compliance and enhanced
operational resilience.
Ooredoo Qatar, a leading Doha-based telco, earned this award for its advanced analytical capabilities and AI-
powered customer engagement strategy. This strategy is built on Teradata VantageCloud and ClearScape
Analytics, which were integrated with and run on GCP native services.
Sicredi, Brazil's largest financial cooperative, was honored for its innovative use of ClearScape Analytics and our
cloud platform to transform credit risk management as well as support sustainability initiatives. Most recently,
Sicredi has also begun developing an AI agent to support provision analysis under Brazilian banking regulations,
further strengthening its governance and risk management capabilities.
We also held our first AgentBuilder workshop at the Possible event. This hands-on workshop was oversubscribed
and packed with customers keen to build AI agents on Teradata. We're in the process of launching an online
AgentBuilder experience to help accelerate the development and deployment of autonomous, contextually
intelligent AI agents. It will be available from our website in the coming weeks.
We held our annual partner forum concurrently with the Possible event and we had strong year-on-year growth in
partner participation. Companies that will win in the Agentic AI future will be the ones that create the most trusted,
interoperable foundation that lets every other AI innovation flourish. We believe that's our role in the ecosystem.
We strive to be the trusted data foundation that makes everyone else's AI work better with the governance layer
that lets companies experiment safely.
We are partnering across all layers in the ecosystem. And we had strong partner co-sell activity in the third
quarter, validating the strength in our ecosystem in identifying and nurturing new opportunities.
While at our event, I hosted a fireside chat with one of our partners, ServiceNow. We discussed how together we
can power autonomous operations at scale by combining our enterprise-grade analytics with ServiceNow's
workflow engine. Our platforms work together to enable seamless integration, governance and automation. We're
collaborating to help customers realize the full potential of their data, delivering intelligence and automation at
enterprise scale.
This is how we enable AI-native transformation for our customers, empowering organizations to break down silos,
unlock real-time intelligence, and transform every part of their business. By combining deep analytics, trusted
data and intelligent workflow automation, we're enabling organizations to move from passive data collection to
active agentic operations, delivering real-time insights, proactive engagement and measurable business value.
Exciting stuff. And that was just one of the leading partners that participated with us.
We also hosted a number of industry analysts and a comment from Constellation Research summarized our
focus on helping provide context to AI, noting that we believe there is no AI without context. That context isn't just
data, it's the metadata, business logic and domain knowhow that make AI decisions relevant and reliable. Without
business context, even the best algorithms can't deliver the accuracy or explainability needed in real-world
regulated environments.

They also recognize that we are turning our decades of decision analysis experience into domain and industry
knowledge models that give AI agents real context and that our context intelligence framework captures how
industries actually operate, so organizations don't have to start from scratch as we help teams build agents faster,
with enterprise-grade performance, governance and trust already built in.
Our hybrid capabilities are resonating in our customer base with interest in our recent product introductions, AI
Factory, MCP server and AgentBuilder giving us further conviction that we offer a unique value proposition. We
provide the flexibility to have consistent data, compute, models, workloads, outcomes and experiences across a
hybrid environment.
We have full confidence in total ARR and are affirming our outlook for 2025. In our recent discussions with
customers, we have seen how the Teradata knowledge platform is ideally suited for AI workloads. AI is always on
with ever increasing agents driving massive complex query volumes. That's Teradata's sweet spot. Our ARR mix
may vary as we see customers evaluating between cloud and on-prem for where to deploy the workloads as they
build for their AI-enabled future. Regardless of the deployment options they choose, customers can rely on
Teradata to run agentic AI at scale and provide the context needed for trusted results.
Thank you very much. Now I'll turn the call over to John.

John Ederer
Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Thank you, Steve. And good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with the progress we're making this year as we've
demonstrated a return to consistent execution with our third quarter in a row of meeting or exceeding our
guidance metrics. And perhaps as importantly, we expect that trend to continue in Q4 as we are reiterating our
guidance for the full year.
Looking at a few of the highlights for the third quarter, total ARR growth was ahead of expectations, representing
the second consecutive quarter of a return to positive growth. We exceeded the top end of our total revenue and
recurring revenue guidance. We improved gross margin sequentially from Q2. We delivered considerable upside
on our non-GAAP earnings per share and we increased free cash flow on a year-over-year basis for Q3 and the
year to date.
Finally, as Steve commented, we are building a solid foundation this year to deliver continued financial
improvement next year. In terms of our detailed financial results for the third quarter, total ARR grew 1% as
reported and flat in constant currency. This was our second consecutive quarter of a return to total ARR growth
and this was driven by better retention and expansions in the quarter.
At the beginning of the year, our target was to get back to positive total ARR growth by Q4. And we are pleased to
be several quarters ahead of schedule. Cloud ARR grew 11% on an as reported and constant currency basis and
the cloud net expansion rate was 109%. As discussed on our Q2 earnings call, we expected Q3 cloud ARR
growth to be below our guidance range for the year due to the pull forward of a few deals last quarter.
Total revenue was $416 million, down 5% year-over-year as reported, and 6% in constant currency, which was 1
point above the high end of our outlook due to higher recurring revenue. Recurring revenue was $366 million,
down 2% year-over-year as reported, and 3% in constant currency, which was 1 point above the high end of our
outlook.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 04-Nov-2025
Recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 88%, up from 85% in Q3 last year. Services revenue
was $47 million, which was consistent with our recent performance. We are seeing a transition in our services
business this year as the team is moving from migration projects to delivering AI services which we believe will
provide improved performance next year.
Looking at profitability and free cash flow please note that I will be referencing non-GAAP numbers for expenses
and margins and a full reconciliation to GAAP results is provided in our press release. For the third quarter, total
gross margin was 62.3%, which was up 70 basis points year-over-year. On a sequential basis, total gross margin
was up 400 basis points, driven by improvements on both recurring and services gross margins.
Recurring revenue, gross margin was 68.9%, up 140 basis points sequentially. On services gross margin, we took
actions last quarter to align our costs with current revenue and we made substantial improvement in non-GAAP
gross margin from negative 2% in Q2 to positive 8.5% in Q3. Operating margin for Q3 was 23.6%, which was up
110 basis points year-over-year and up 720 basis points sequentially. Overall, we are seeing improving margins
as a result of cost efficiency actions we started last year.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.72 exceeding the top end of our outlook range by $0.17. The
outperformance was driven by higher recurring revenue and lower expenses. We generated $88 million of free
cash flow in the quarter, which was up 28% on a year-over-year basis and provides us with increased confidence
in our full year outlook.
And finally, in the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $30 million of our stock or 1.4 million shares. We
continue to target returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases this year.
Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. For the fourth quarter of 2025, we expect recurring revenue
to be in the range of minus 1% to minus 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. We expect total
revenue to be in the range of minus 2% to minus 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. And we expect
non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.57.
For fiscal 2025, we reiterate our previous guidance for total ARR growth and we are maintaining our range for
cloud ARR growth. We have confidence in our total ARR target and continue to see a path to our cloud ARR
range for the year. However, there are a handful of deals where customers are still assessing deployment
options, which could have an impact on the mix between cloud and on-premise subscription ARR.
We also reiterate our previous guidance for recurring revenue and total revenue. Given the guidance ranges that
we provided for Q4, we anticipate recurring revenue and total revenue to be at the midpoint of our fiscal 2025
ranges.
On free cash flow, due to our strong performance year-to-date, we are narrowing the range to the top end of our
initial outlook and now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $260 million to $280 million.
Finally, we are raising our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to a range of $2.38 to $2.42, reflecting our
strong performance in Q3.
Based on foreign exchange rates at the end of September, we anticipate 1 to 2 points of benefit to our Q4 2025
revenue. For the full year, we do not anticipate any material currency impact.

Finally, we expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 23.1% and the weighted average shares
outstanding to be 96.1 million for the full year. Again, please refer to our Q3 earnings presentation on our Investor
Relations website for a complete list of our 2025 outlook ranges.
In closing, we are taking actions that we believe will ultimately drive shareholder value. The first important steps
were to: one, return total ARR growth to positive territory; two, focus on cost efficiencies; three, drive consistency
in the business; and four, stabilize free cash flow, all of which we're on track to achieve this year.
As we start to focus on the objectives for next year, we are prioritizing our investments to capitalize on the
substantial opportunity ahead for Teradata as a leading AI and knowledge platform for the autonomous
enterprise. We believe that these investments, combined with the continued optimization of our business, will
enable us to deliver profitable growth and higher free cash flow.
Thank you all for your time today. Now, let's open up the call for questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of giving everyone an opportunity, we appreciate
that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Your first question comes from the line of Erik Woodring
of Morgan Stanley. Erik, your line is open. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik W. Woodring Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Oh, great. Thank you guys for taking my question. Steve, really nice to see the earnings and free cash flow
upside this quarter. I think, this is the first time since you began disclosing cloud ARR that we've seen sequentials
be negative intra-calendar year for cloud ARR. I know you mentioned that it would dip below the target range this
quarter, but I guess I look at the 11% and say it felt a bit below maybe where you would have expected
sequentials. But maybe you could just elaborate on how the quarter transpired for cloud ARR, when and where
we see that net expansion rate bottom and maybe why we just aren't de-risking 4Q a bit, just given some of your
commentary around customers assessing where they're going to be deploying with Teradata. And then a quick
follow-up. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Erik. So, I think, on cloud, we did perform to our expectations. As we said in our Q2 earnings, we
did expect that linearity to be below the full year outlook. I think, as we look at the market, we're no longer seeing
that kind of headlong rush to the cloud. It's much more of a nuanced decision of how our customers can
accelerate the time to value for the AI workloads that they're deploying in their environment. And we're continuing
to see that pattern of customers using our hybrid capabilities.
I think, I've said in the past that a good proportion of our cloud customers have deployments both on-prem and in
the cloud with us, and they can decide across that massive data estate that they run from a Teradata perspective,
where to run that workload. And I think that's nicely evidenced, actually, by the fact that our total ARR growth is
ahead of schedule overall. We expected to return to growth in the fourth quarter. So, being ahead of schedule
from that perspective and demonstrating that we're growing overall with our customers is a good achievement as
we've executed through the year.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 04-Nov-2025
We do start to see our net expansion rate starting to consolidate. And I think as we look at the overall results for
the year in terms of our guidance, we're pretty confident in our total ARR growth. And as we look to 2026, we
continue to see a path for continuing ARR growth in 2026.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik W. Woodring Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thank you very much, Steve. And then just a quick follow-up. Your comment on – I think you used the term
meaningful free cash flow growth into 2026, at least to me was the most confident I've heard you sound on free
cash flow looking forward in a while. Can you maybe just unpack where this confidence comes from? I'm sure it
has to do with ARR growth and some of your OpEx initiatives, but just – I know, you're not going to guide to 2026,
but any way you can help us think about when you talked about meaningful free cash flow growth, kind of what
you're trying to tell us between the lines and that's it for me. Thanks so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Erik. I think you hit the nail on the head with the two points, but I'll just ask John to add any more
color.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Ederer A
Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Yeah, I think that's exactly right. I mean, I think if you look at how this year is progressing, we've done a nice job
on free cash flow relative to where we were at this point last year. And I think we're doing the right things and
really focusing on this as a key driver for us, certainly getting total ARR back to growth territory has had a positive
impact and then the cost actions that we've taken last year and this year as well are also supporting that number.
And so, we feel like we're putting the right pieces in place to continue that improvement next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Perfect. Thank you. Our next question comes from Radi Sultan of UBS. Radi, your line is open.
Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Radi Sultan Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Awesome. Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. First for Steve, last quarter, we talked about I think it was
roughly a third of pipeline, including an AI component. So, I guess first, like how did that track this quarter? And
you mentioned, the agent offerings. MCP server. Like, is there any area in particular within the AI portfolio moving
the needle? And then any way to think about how these AI discussions more broadly are impacting competitive
win rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Radi. Yeah, we're continuing to see that the AI influence pipeline increase, sort of,
increase as we went through Q3, which is really great to see. We have supported that with a fantastic set of
innovation and releases from a product perspective. Our new Chief Product Officer, Sumeet, is making a real
difference there in terms of we're measuring our innovation releases in terms of time from concept to press
release. And I think, as evidenced by the discussions we had with our customers at our most recent marketing
event, they were really seeing those innovations as something that Teradata can provide in a holistic way to

enable them to deploy Agentic AI workloads, whether it's from our Enterprise Vector Store capabilities, our MCP
server, our AgentBuilder capabilities or ModelOps where we can include language model capabilities.
So all of these, I think, are coming together. And one of our customers actually, I think said it best, where they
said, Teradata is one provider in this area who's really putting it all together. But I think the most interesting thing,
Radi, from a technology perspective is that we are seeing that the Teradata technology platform is really built for
these AI workloads. When you think about an always-on AI agent, essentially they can execute thousands of
queries and complex queries. So, really large volumes of queries, executing concurrently inside an environment
with different types of workload, our architecture inside Teradata are massively parallel architecture combined
with our workload management and query optimization allows our customers to run those types of queries. And
the AI agents that they have developed to run those queries more effectively and efficiently than anybody else.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Radi Sultan Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Awesome. Thanks. And then second for John. You've been in the seat a couple quarters now, strung together a
couple nice quarters, I guess is it fair to think about your approach to guidance being relatively consistent since
you joined? And maybe are there any leading indicators or KPIs in particular that you're looking at that give you
confidence in the outlook, especially around Q4?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Ederer A
Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Yeah, thanks for the question. And I would say, from an overall standpoint, I guess, in terms of guidance and our
philosophy on it, we try to call it as we see it. And so, we take a look at our forecast. We do have a number of
KPIs that we'll look at from pipeline to our expenses to the revenue model, et cetera. There's a whole bunch of
metrics that we'll take a look at and roll all of that up.
When you talk about Q4 in particular, you're now getting down to the last few months and we're literally going deal
by deal. And so, we've got that kind of granularity in terms of how we ultimately roll up the forecast and then our
resulting guidance from it.

Hi. Thanks for taking the questions here. Steve, maybe I'll start with you, great to see everyone coming that way.
But I wanted to just follow-on what Radi was asking, like, around the competitive edge, the Agentic AI strategy
with autonomous how that's possible and then AgentBuilder like really position Teradata directly against some of

this roadmap of your larger hyperscaler platform and even competitors like Databricks and Snowflake. Can you
kind of help us understand what is really the longer-term durability, the competitive advantage that you see that
Teradata can compete in the space? And is it more the hybrid cloud environment that you've been talking about
and then all the small enterprise, the IP within your decades of experience? Maybe you can start there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah, thanks for the question, YC. I think, fundamentally what sets us apart is actually our technology moat that
we have already. It's the set of patented capabilities that allow us to execute these workloads in the most effective
and efficient way. And we can do that both on-prem and in the cloud. So, really being able to deliver that hybrid
environment to our customers is clearly a differentiator for us.
We announced earlier in the year our AI Factory, which essentially combines a lot of capabilities together. We're
partnered with Nvidia in terms of the development of that AI Factory. That gives us a fantastic base for future on-
prem capabilities. We're looking forward to the next release of our Teradata technology platform, which will have
GPUs built right into the platform in terms of executing that workload. But our customers are already using their
Teradata on-prem platform to actually operate and execute AI workloads today in a very reliable way. And we're
seeing it both – in a real hybrid context, so both on-prem and in the cloud.
At the end of the day, we see this as being a battle of the query engine. And we believe that our query engine is
the best query engine to deliver AI type workloads and to be that true knowledge platform in terms of building
enterprise context for our customers. And that's built on all of the capabilities and solutions that we've developed
over the last 40 years for our customers. We understand the domains around customer experience or supply
chain management, and we understand the domains across all of the industries.
So, all of these things combined together to give us our unique positioning. And we are really excited about
getting that message out to the marketplace and demonstrating that to customers on a day-to-day basis.

Yitchuin Wong Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Well, understood. Maybe one for John here. You talked about like the much improved service gross margin to
positive territory in the quarter. It's great to see an inflection there. Could you kind of help us double click on some
of these actions? I know, we heard talk about the team starting to leverage more FTE or maybe even AI FTEs
here within the sales motion, especially with these newer AI use cases. Is this something that's expected to go
forward that could help drive better margins here and/or even efficiency driving like AI, leveraging AI within the
company that you touched on a little bit during Possible as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Ederer A
Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. So, I think, a couple of different questions in there. I think, in terms of the services business overall, to be
perfectly honest, a lot of that is just rightsizing the organization for the current revenue stream that we've got
there. We saw some headwinds this year due to higher migration activity in the prior year. And so, for us in the
first couple of quarters, we were a little bit behind in that from a cost structure standpoint and we fixed that in the
second quarter and we saw a nice rebound in Q3 and we think we've got some room to go in Q4. And so, I think
again there it's just aligning the costs with the anticipated revenue.

In terms of your broader question around margins overall and some of the things that we're doing with AI from an
internal standpoint, there's actually quite a bit and I won't do it justice, but I would encourage you to check out
some of the presentations at our Possible conference. We had one that talked specifically about some of the
things that we're doing internally, and there's a whole workstream around this that's really touching all parts of the
business from cost of revenue through the operating lines.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
And I'll just add to that, YC, I think from an AI services perspective, we're seeing customers have a real appetite
to deploy real solutions. So, with the launch of our Customer Intelligence Framework and also backing that up
with real consulting expertise, folks that can actually implement AI solutions inside our customers, we're really
pivoting our consulting and services capability to deliver something that we see as a supply constrained
marketplace in terms of folks that actually know how to deploy these solutions inside our customer base.
So, our most recent press release in the last couple of weeks around AI services and the capabilities that we have
to help enable our customers in this market is super exciting. And we're obviously, of course, working alongside
our partners to deliver those capabilities to the market is super important for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Yitchuin Wong Q

go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chirag Ved Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Following up on one of the prior questions here, I was wondering whether you
could speak to the underlying trajectory of cloud versus on-prem at this point over the next couple quarters, even
qualitatively, should we end up more on the on-prem side of the business when we're looking out or – and
perhaps moderating cloud growth? And then any comments you might have on the associated margin and pricing
implications, if you can share that. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah, I'll start and maybe John can make some comments. So, I think to – Chirag, thanks for the query. I think,
we are definitely seeing that our on-prem is stabilizing and we're seeing a rate of change and improvement and
that's due to an – from an on-prem perspective, both retention and expansion of those on-prem environments. On
that, we certainly are happy with our retention rates. It's in line enterprise software overall, but the fact is we will
take growth wherever we see it. Right. And we're well positioned to take advantage of growth in this hybrid
environment that some of our customers have got, but we're also really well placed to take advantage of on-prem
growth for data sovereignty requirements of where the data gravity is on-prem. But we also see the fact that we

can grow in the cloud successfully with our customers. We're seeing our expansion rates in the cloud tick up as
we've gone through this year in comparison to some of our other years. And we expect that to continue from an
expansion perspective.
And so, I think, we're well placed to take advantage of the opportunity that's in front of us, and we'll see that
growth in terms of that hybrid platform that we offer to the market.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chirag Ved Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay, got it. Thanks. That's really helpful. Maybe just one more. Great to see more of a focus on AI services
within consulting, really speaks to the importance and percolation of this technology. Looking ahead, do you see
consulting revenue stabilizing a bit at this point, driven by the focus on delivering AI services? Or is this still a
category that you're involved with, but starting to or continuing to shift over to your partner ecosystem?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah, I think, we've – at our core, we're a technology company. We're about ARR growth. We do consulting and
services to support our technology ARR growth. And clearly the margin profile for that is where we want to
operate. We've created that headroom, as we've discussed in terms of creating that space for our partners to
operate successfully with us.
But I think every great technology organization needs a great consulting and services capability to support that
technology value proposition. And it's great to be able to see our consulting and services organization pivot
towards these AI services so that the relevance in the marketplace can increase and it can help our existing
customer base and new customers that we come across deploy these AI solutions, and we see it actually as a
great competitive differentiator.
We've got a go-to-market motion now that supports a forward-deployed engineering model to get POCs into our
customers. But our consulting and services teams and their partners are going to ensure that they take those
POCs from that – proof-of-concept into reality and into production. And we've already seen success with our
customers in terms of taking real problems and business domains that they have and turning it into production-
ready capabilities. So, really time to value from an ROI perspective is super important and we see our AI services
capabilities as something that's going to support that.

Michael Richards Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, guys, this is Mike Richards on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question here. Maybe just double clicking on
that dynamic where customers are assessing the deployment option. Just curious, is that a result of the
announcement of the hardware refresh next year, where maybe some customers are seeing the transformation
you're bringing to the on-prem offering and now it's a bigger decision of whether or not to stay or move to the
cloud, and then just any early feedback you've gotten on that decision to have this big refresh. Thanks, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Hey, thanks, Mike, for the question. No, I wouldn't say it's got anything to do with the technology platform that
we're coming out with next. I think, the technology that we have in place today is actually enabling some of these
decisions, both in terms of things like the AI Factory, which are available today on the technology stack that we
have. It's actually given the customers exactly what they want. They want the choice of deployment. They want to
be able to just choose where they put the workloads and we offer our customers a workload-first deployment
model. So, they can choose whether they want to run the workload in the cloud or whether they want to run it on-
prem. And so, that's the decision-making that our customers are going through. And the fact that we offer those
technology capabilities in that hybrid environment is essentially giving our customers the choice of deployment.

Operator: Perfect. Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Raimo, your line is

Raimo Lenschow Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Steve, thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in, and congrats from me as well on the great quarter. The quick
question, Steve, more for you. If you think about the debate of where AI gets that data from, there is a kind of big
debate, kind of is it coming out of the operational data stores and Oracle, et cetera is making not more out of like
the data warehouses like you guys or more out of the data lakes. Can you speak to that, how you see that playing
out or is it different use cases will have like a different data foundation? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Raimo, you answered the question right at the very end. I think, we are actually seeing customers want to get the
best out of their data no matter where it sits. That's why we love QueryGrid as our technology to be able to
combine all of these different data stores together. So, no matter where the data is in the ecosystem, they can
take that in a highly governed, reliable way and combine it together, whether it's coming from the data lake or
whether it's coming from an enterprise data warehouse and they can feed that into a language model in a very
trusted environment. And that's what we're really delivering and offering to our customers.
So, I think, this is all about – if you think about AI solutions, they have to be trusted. They have to be ethical. You
have to be able to track back through it, and they have to run efficiently and effectively. And that's where the
Teradata platform enables our customers to do by combining all of those data sources together.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 04-Nov-2025
Derrick Wood Q
Analyst, TD Cowen
Great. Thanks for taking my question. This is for you, John. You guys had nice outperformance on recurring
revenue in Q3, but now for Q4, we had been kind of assuming low single digit growth implied from your guide last
quarter to now low single-digit decline. So, was there any kind of pull forward of deals from Q4 to Q3 or what
would you call out on the change in the Q4 growth assumptions? And if I could just squeeze one other in on the
cloud NER having kind of dropped to 109%, just remind us what the main drag for this number are and any color
on kind of when and where this could start to stabilize and perhaps move back up? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Ederer A
Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Derrick. So, on the recurring revenue side of things, I think our guidance for the year has
actually been fairly consistent on the recurring revenue piece. We did have some variability if you look quarter-to-
quarter, and that comes from the upfront portion of the on-premise subscriptions. And so, depending on the mix of
that, in any given quarter, you might have more upfront revenue which would otherwise throw off your expected
linearity. In terms of the net expansion rate, we have seen some consolidation on that. If you look at what we've
done historically and even I think for this year, we're still on track for the same, about 50% of our expansion rate is
coming from migration activity and the remainder is coming from expansions with existing customers. And so, we
see that continuing into Q4. Right now, you're seeing those rates consolidate. So, the net expansion rate is pretty
close to what you're seeing for the cloud ARR growth overall.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Perfect. Thank you. Our penultimate question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Wamsi,
your line is open. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Wamsi Mohan Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yes, thank you. I think, Steve, you mentioned sort of cost takeout, helping free cash flow into next year. Can you
help us maybe think about just the absolute sort of OpEx trajectory going from here into 2026? How are you
thinking about the relative progression from here? And if I could just I know federal is not really very large for you
guys, but are you seeing any impact at all from the government shutdown? Thank you so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah, I'll take the first – the last question first, Wamsi. No, we're not seeing any impact to our revenues from – as
a result of the federal shutdown. And then just from an OpEx perspective, clearly we've taken some fairly major
restructuring activities through the year. And a lot of them in the kind of June timeframe and then into the
September timeframe. So, we are expecting full year of impacts and benefits to essentially ultimately our free
cash flow position as we move into 2026. So, we are expecting that to amplify.
And I think in relation to one of the other questions, John hit it on the head, we're expecting that free cash flow
growth to come from both our ARR growth expectations for 2026 and also the operational efficiency effectiveness,
productivity measures that we've executed in 2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. And our final question for today comes from Patrick Walravens of Citizens. Patrick, your
line is open. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Patrick Walravens Q
Analyst, Citizens JMP Securities LLC
No, great. Thank you so much. John, this one's for you, too. And I know this was a good quarter but as you divide
your free cash flow by the revenue, you get like 21%. Not putting a timeframe on it or anything, but where can that
free cash flow margin go?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Ederer A
Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Yeah, no, it's a good question. And I think, it's somewhat related to what Steve just commented on in terms of the
operating leverage. And if you look – if you step back and look at what we did this year with revenue headwinds,
we don't guide on operating margins specifically. But I think if you do the math and reverse engineer, you're going
to find that the operating margin has to be pretty flat and comparable with where we were last year. So, that
means in the face of revenue headwinds, we're still able to capture that margin percentage. And we've done
some things from an operational standpoint, a cost efficiency standpoint that will continue to benefit us next year.
And so, I won't give you a number today, but suffice to say that we've done some things this year that we think set
us up well for next year from a margin and a cash flow standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Thanks, Pat, for the question and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We are absolutely committed to show
what the AI future holds for our customers and what our differentiated platform and capabilities can deliver. As we
continue our focus on execution we're really confident in our outlook and we are looking forward to updating you
all next quarter. Thank you very much. And operator, you can end the call.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now all disconnect your lines.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2025
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying
this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional
disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable
GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate
assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, tariff and trade
policies and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears; inflation, interest rates,
regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce cloud services
and new and emerging technologies and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions,
restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and
therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
And now I'll turn the call over to Andy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
Thanks, Dave. We saw strong growth across our business in Q3, and we're reporting $180.2 billion in revenue, up
12% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates.
Operating income was $17.4 billion, but would have been over $21 billion, if not for two special Q3 expenses,
$2.5 billion for an FTC settlement and $1.8 billion for estimated severance costs. Trailing 12-month free cash flow
was $14.8 billion.
I'll start with AWS. AWS is growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022, reaccelerating to 20.2% year-over-
year, our largest growth rate in 11 quarters. It's worth remembering that year-over-year percentage growth is a
relative term. It's very different having 20% year-over-year growth on a $132 billion annualized run rate and to
have a higher percentage growth rate on a meaningfully smaller annual revenue, which is the case with our
competitors.
Backlog grew to $200 billion by Q3 quarter end and doesn't include several unannounced new deals in October,
which together are more than our total deal volume for all of Q3. AWS is gaining momentum. Customers want to
be running their core and AI workloads in AWS given its stronger functionality, security and operational
performance and the scale I see in front of us gives me significant confidence in what lies ahead. I'll share a little
more detail on why.
It starts with AWS having much broader infrastructure functionality. Start-ups, enterprises and governments want
to move their production workloads to the place that has the broadest and deepest array of capabilities.
AWS has more services and deeper features within those services than anybody else and continues to innovate
at a rapid clip. These are key building blocks for anything that customers want to create, and they're a big part of
why Gartner has named AWS leader in its Strategic Cloud Platform Services Magic Quadrant for 15 consecutive
years.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2025
We're bringing the same building block approach to AI. SageMaker makes it much simpler for companies to build
and deploy their own foundation models. Bedrock gives customers leading selection of foundation models and
superior price performance to deploy inference into their next-generation applications. A lot of the future value
companies will get from AI will be in the form of agents. AWS is heavily investing in this area and well-positioned
to be a leader.
Companies will both create their own agents and use agents from other companies. For those building their own,
it's been harder to build than it should be. It's why we launched Strands to make it much easier to create agents
from any foundation model that builders desire.
For companies who successfully built agents, they've hesitated putting them into production because they lack
secure scalable runtime services or memory or observability built specifically for agents. It's why we launched
AgentCore, a set of infrastructure building blocks that allow builders to deploy secure, scalable agents.
Ericsson used AgentCore to deliver AI agents across their workforce. Sony used it to build an agentic AI platform
with enterprise-level security, observability and scalability. And Cohere Health is using AgentCore to deploy
agents that will reduce medical review times by up to 30% to 40%. AgentCore's SDK has already been
downloaded over 1 million times, and our builders are excited about it. It's an enabler.
Companies will also use other's agents, and AWS continues to build many of the agents we believe builders will
use in the future. For coding, we've recently opened up our agentic coding IDE called Kiro. More than 100,000
developers jumped into Kiro in just the first few days of preview and that number has more than doubled since. It's
processed trillions of tokens thus far, weekly actives are growing fast, and developers love its unique spec and
tool calling capabilities.
For migration transformation, we offer an agent called Transform. Year-to-date, customers have already used it to
save 700,000 hours of manual effort, the equivalent of 335 developer years of work. For example, Thomson
Reuters used it to transform 1.5 million lines of code per month, moving from Windows to open-source
alternatives and completing tasks [ph] four (06:49) times faster than with other migration tools.
Customers have also already used Transform to analyze nearly 1 billion lines of mainframe code as they move
mainframe applications to the cloud. For business customers, we've recently launched Quick Suite to bring a
consumer AI-like experience to work, making it easy to find insights, conduct deep research, automate tasks,
visualize data and take actions.
We've already seen users churn months long projects into days, get 80% plus time savings on complex tasks and
realize 90% plus cost savings. And for contact centers, we offer Amazon Connect which creates a more
personalized and efficient experience for contact center agents, managers and their customers.
Connect has recently crested $1 billion annualized revenue run rate with 12 billion minutes of customer
interactions being handled by AI in the last year and is being used by large enterprises like Capital One, Toyota,
American Airlines and Ryanair. These are real practical results for customers and there are many more examples
like them.
Because of its advantaged capabilities, security, operational performance and customer focus, AWS continues to
earn most of the big enterprise and government transformations to the cloud. As a result, AWS is where the
preponderance of company's data and workloads reside and part of why most companies want to run AI in AWS.

To enable customers to do so, we need to have the requisite capacity, and we've been focused on accelerating
capacity the last several months, adding more than 3.8 gigawatts of power in the past 12 months, more than any
other cloud provider. To put that into perspective, we're now double the power capacity that AWS was in 2022,
and we're on track to double again by 2027.
In the last quarter of this year alone, we expect to add at least another 1 gigawatt of power. This capacity consists
of power, data center and chips, primarily our custom silicon, Trainium and NVIDIA.
We've recently brought Project Rainier online, our massive AI compute cluster spanning multiple US data centers
and containing nearly 500,000 of our Trainium2 chips. Anthropic is using it now to build and deploy its industry-
leading AI model, Claude, which we expect to be on more than 1 million Trainium2 chips by year-end.
Trainium2 continues to see strong adoption, is fully subscribed and is now a multibillion-dollar business that grew
150% quarter-over-quarter. Today, Trainium is being used by a small number of very large customers, but we
expect to accommodate more customers starting with Trainium3.
We're building Bedrock to be the biggest inference engine in the world and in the long run, believe Bedrock could
be as big a business for AWS as EC2, and the majority of token usage in Amazon Bedrock is already running on
Trainium.
We're also continuing to work closely with chip partners like NVIDIA, with whom we continue to order very
significant amounts as well as with AMD and Intel. These are very important partners with whom we expect to
keep growing our relationships over time.
You're going to see us continue to be very aggressive investing in capacity because we see the demand. As fast
as we're adding capacity right now, we're monetizing it. It's still quite early and represents an unusual opportunity
for customers in AWS.
I'll now turn to stores, where the team continues to deliver and innovate for customers across our key priorities;
selection, low prices and convenience, particularly fast delivery. We're offering 14% more selection since last
quarter from popular brands like The North Face and Charlotte Tilbury, and we've added hundreds of thousands
of items from popular brands this year.
Everyday Essentials continues to grow quickly, and year-to-date is growing nearly twice as fast as the rest of the
business. We continue to make it easier for customers to order low-priced perishable groceries from Amazon, and
customers in more than 1,000 cities and towns now can shop fresh groceries alongside millions of Amazon.com
products with free same-day delivery. This is a game changer for customers who can now order milk alongside
electronics, check out with one cart and have everything delivered to their doorstep within hours.
The team also invented a new Add to Delivery button that lets customers add items to previously scheduled
orders and it's been used more than 80 million times since launch, and it just launched. It's an example of one of
those seemingly simple, but powerful innovations that make customers' lives easier.
We remain committed to staying sharp on price and meeting or beating prices of other major retailers. In July, we
had our biggest Prime Day event ever, with customers saving billions of dollars across more than 35 categories.
We continue to break records on speed. We're on track to deliver at our fastest speeds ever for Prime members
globally once again this year, and we've started rolling out three-hour delivery in select US cities.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2025
We're also continuing to invest in infrastructure to speed up rural deliveries and serve more customers in more
communities. That includes committing over $4 billion to expand our rural delivery network across the US. These
are small towns where people want fast delivery, but where other companies have been backing out and reducing
service. In contrast, we've already increased the number of rural communities with access to our same-day and
next-day delivery by 60%, reaching roughly half of the total communities we plan to expand to by the end of the
year.
The stores team is also innovating rapidly with AI. For example, Rufus, our AI-powered shopping assistant, has
had 250 million active customers this year with monthly users up 140% year-over-year, interactions up 210%
year-over-year and customers using Rufus during a shopping trip being 60% more likely to complete a purchase.
Rufus is on track to deliver over $10 billion in incremental annualized sales.
Here are the highlights. Our generative AI-powered audio feature that combines product summaries and reviews
to make shopping easier has expanded from hundreds of products at launch to millions of products and millions of
customers have used it streaming almost 3 million minutes.
In Amazon Lens, an AI-powered visual search tool that lets customers find products with their phone's camera, a
screenshot or a bar code, now includes Lens Live, which instantly scans products and shows real-time matches in
a swipeable carousel. Tens and millions of customers are using Amazon Lens each month.
Moving on to Amazon Ads. We're pleased with the continued strong growth, generating $17.6 billion of revenue in
the quarter and growing 22% year-over-year. We see strength across our broad portfolio of full funnel advertising
offerings that helps advertisers reach an average ad-supported audience of more than 300 million in the US
alone.
We also continue to be excited about our demand side platform, Amazon DSP, which lets advertisers plan,
activate and measure full funnel investments. Last quarter, I mentioned our partnership with Roku and we've built
on that with a partnership with Netflix, providing advertisers using Amazon DSP with direct access to Netflix's
premium ad inventory.
We announced integrations with Spotify and SiriusXM. With Spotify, we provide advertisers with direct
programmatic access to a global audience of more than 400 million monthly ad-supported listeners. And with
SiriusXM, brands can reach 160 million monthly digital listeners across services like Pandora and SoundCloud.
And we're excited about the advertising opportunity around Prime Video live sports. Live sports got a lot of
interest from advertisers in upfront negotiations for 2025-2026, and we exceeded our own expectations for upfront
commitments with significant growth across the board.
Finally, we're continuing to innovate for advertisers with AI. For example, in September, we announced an Agentic
AI tool and creative studio that plans and executes the entire creative process in a matter of hours instead of
weeks.
We're also inventing and seeing strong momentum in several other areas, and I'll mention just a few. In Prime
Video live sports, NBA on Prime tipped off last week and our opening night doubleheader averaged 1.25 million
viewers in the US, a double-digit increase over last season on cable. You'll see us bring the same constant
innovation here that we brought to our NFL broadcast.

We're adding golf with The Masters in 2026 and new Skins competition with the PGA Tour on Black Friday this
year. And we've added Peacock and FOX One to Prime Videos add-on subscription offering of over 100 channels
in the US.
We continue to be energized by the response to Alexa+. Compared to what we call the classic Alexa experience,
Alexa+ customers are talking to Alexa 2 times more. Those interactions are much longer, and they're covering a
broader range of topics.
So, using Alexa+ and Fire TV at 2.5 times the rate of classic, using natural conversation to discover audio content
4 times more, engaging with photos 4 times more and customers are completing 4 times more shopping
conversations that end in a purchase.
We've expanded the number of Project Kuiper satellites in space to more than 150 and delivered over 1 gigabit
per second speeds in tests with our enterprise-grade customer terminal, the first commercial phased array we
know of to clear that threshold.
Finally, Zoox robotaxis are available to riders in Las Vegas, and we've announced Washington, D.C. as the eighth
testing location. We're excited for these to continue rolling out to more riders.
Q4 is one of our busiest and most energizing times of the year, and we're excited about the continued demand for
AWS. The innovations we'll announce at re:Invent in December, the positive customer response to our AI-
powered experiences, all the gifts we'll be delivering throughout the holiday season and a lot more.
Thanks in advance to our teammates around the world who are gearing up to deliver for customers once again.
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Olsavsky
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Amazon.com, Inc.
Thanks, Andy. Starting with our top-line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $180.2 billion, a 12% increase
year-over-year, excluding a 90 basis point favorable impact of foreign exchange.
In Q3, we reported worldwide operating income of $17.4 billion. This operating income includes two special
charges, which reduced operating income by $4.3 billion. The first charge of $2.5 billion is related to a legal
settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which impacts the North America segment and is recorded in the
other operating expense line.
The second charge of $1.8 billion relates to severance costs for role eliminations and impacts all three of our
segments. The severance charge is recorded primarily in the technology and infrastructure, sales and marketing,
and general and administrative expense line items. Excluding these two charges, worldwide operating income
would have been $21.7 billion or $1.2 billion above the high end of our guidance range.
Moving to our segment results. We remain encouraged by the innovation our teams are delivering for customers
across all three segments. In the North America segment, third quarter revenue was $106.3 billion, an increase of
11% year-over-year.
International segment revenue was $40.9 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact of
foreign exchange. Worldwide paid units grew 11% year-over-year.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2025
We continue to prioritize the inputs that matter most to our customers. In the third quarter, our sharp pricing,
broad selection and fast delivery speeds continue to resonate with customers.
Customers appreciate the ability to quickly receive items essential for their daily needs, including perishable
groceries and have them delivered on the same day. Our millions of global third-party sellers continue to be
important contributors to our vast selection, which helps customers find the items they need at competitive prices.
We're committed to building innovative services and features for our sellers, including our ongoing advancements
in generative AI. Today, more than 1.3 million sellers have used our generative AI capabilities to more quickly
launch high-quality listings. Better listings translate into better traction with customers. And in Q3, worldwide third-
party seller unit mix was 62%, up 200 basis points from Q3 of last year.
Shifting to profitability. North America segment operating income was $4.8 billion, with an operating margin of
4.5%. Excluding the $2.5 billion charge related to the legal settlement with the FTC, North America segment
operating income would have been $7.3 billion with an operating margin of 6.9%. North America segment
operating margin also includes a portion of the severance charge.
International segment operating income was $1.2 billion, with an operating margin of 2.9%. Excluding the impact
of the severance charge, International segment operating margins expanded year-over-year.
Globally, our progress on key inputs is delivering a better customer experience while driving a more efficient cost
structure. For example, we're making notable strides in improving inventory placement to speed up delivery to
customers. And as a result, for the third year in a row, we are on track to deliver our fastest speeds ever for Prime
members in 2025.
We continue to tune and improve our fulfillment operations and our regionalized network is operating at scale. We
see many benefits from our inbound process improvements, including a reduction of US inbound lead time by
nearly four days compared to last year. This allows us to be more efficient with our inventory purchasing, which
benefits working capital.
We're also placing inventory more strategically throughout the network. And by leveraging our existing
infrastructure, we're now offering US customers the ability to order perishable groceries and receive them the
same day in as little as five hours.
We're seeing positive early results since launching in January, when customers started shopping fresh groceries
on Amazon they are visiting the site more often and returning twice as often as non-perishable shoppers.
Looking ahead, we see further opportunity to improve productivity in our global fulfillment and transportation
network. We'll continue to improve inventory placement to drive down distance traveled and touches per package.
We will also build on the gains from our regionalized network through algorithmic improvements as well as
launching robotics and automation. While operating margin may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we have a delivery
approach to achieve sustained progress over the long term.
Shifting to advertising. Advertising revenue was $17.7 billion and growth accelerated for the third consecutive
quarter. We continue to see strong growth on an increasingly large base, as our full funnel advertising approach
of connecting brands with customers is resonating.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2025
Moving next to our AWS segment. Revenue was $33 billion, up 20.2% year-over-year. This is an acceleration of
270 basis points compared to last quarter, driven by strong growth across both our AI and core services and more
capacity, which has come online to support customer demand.
AWS revenue increased $2.1 billion quarter-over-quarter and now has an annualized revenue run rate of $132
billion. AWS operating income was $11.4 billion, and reflects our continued growth, coupled with our focus on
driving efficiencies across the business.
We are expanding our data center footprint, largely to accommodate Gen AI. And to the extent those assets were
placed into service, the related depreciation does impact our margins. As we've long said, we expect AWS
operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of investments we're making at any point in
time.
Now turning to our cash CapEx, which was $34.2 billion in Q3. We've now spent $89.9 billion so far this year. This
primarily relates to AWS as we invest to support demand for our AI and core services and in custom silicon, like
Trainium, as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and international segments.
We'll continue to make significant investments, especially in AI, as we believe it to be a massive opportunity with
the potential for strong returns on invested capital over the long term. Additionally, we continue to invest in our
fulfillment and transportation network to support the growth of the business, improve delivery speeds and lower
our cost to serve. These investments will support growth for many years to come. Looking ahead, we expect our
full year cash CapEx to be approximately $125 billion in 2025, and we expect that amount will increase in 2026.
I'll finish up my remarks with net income. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, our third
quarter net income of $21.2 billion includes a pre-tax gain of $9.5 billion related to our investment in Anthropic.
This investment activity is not related to Amazon's ongoing operations and is included in non-operating income.
We're encouraged by the start of the peak season and we are ready to serve customers in the coming months. I
want to thank our teams across Amazon for their hard work as we get ready to delight customers during the
holiday season. Our commitment to elevating the customer experience is the only reliable way to drive
sustainable value for our shareholders.
With that, let's move on to your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our
first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Justin Post Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Great. Thank you. I'll ask on AWS. Can you just kind of go through how you're feeling about your capacity levels
and how capacity constrained you are right now? And then on your prepared remarks, you mentioned Trainium3
demand and maybe broadening out your customer base. Can you talk about the demand you're seeing outside of
your major customers for Trainium? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah. On the capacity side, we brought in quite a bit of capacity, as I mentioned in my opening comments, 3.8
gigawatts of capacity in the last year with another gigawatt plus coming in the fourth quarter and we expect to
double our overall capacity by the end of 2027. So, we're bringing in quite a bit of capacity. Today, overall in the
industry, maybe the bottleneck is power. I think at some point, it may move to chips, but we're bringing in quite a
bit of capacity. And as fast as we're bringing it in right now, we are monetizing it.
And then on the Trainium demand, outside of our major customers. So, first of all, as I mentioned on Trainium2,
it's really doing well. It's fully subscribed on Trainium2. It's a multibillion-dollar business at this point. It grew 150%
quarter-over-quarter in revenue. And you see really big projects at scale now, like our Project Rainier that we're
doing with Anthropic, where they're running their next version of – they're training the next version of Claude on
top of Trainium2 on 500,000 Trainium2 chips going to 1 million Trainium2 chips by the end of the year.
As I mentioned, today with Trainium2, we have a small number of very large customers on it. But because
Trainium is 30% to 40% more price performant than other options out there, and because as customers – as they
start to contemplate broader scale of their production workloads, moving to being AI-focused and using inference,
they badly care about price performance. And so, we have a lot of demand for Trainium. Trainium3 should
preview at the end of this year with much fuller volumes coming in the beginning of 2026. We have a lot of
customers, both very large, and I'll call it, medium-sized who're quite interested in Trainium3.

Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Nowak Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the quarter, guys. So, maybe two. One, Andy, sort of a philosophical
chip question. There's a lot of questions in the market about Trainium and sort of its positioning versus other third-
party chips. So, how do you think about the key hurdles that Trainium3 need to overcome to really make Trainium
adoption broader, to your point on the last question and continue to drive Trainium as opposed to satisfying what
could be broader demand with third-party chips in the near term?

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2025
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah. Well, first of all, we're always going to have multiple chip options for our customers. It's been true in every
major technology building block or component that we've had in AWS. Really in the history of AWS, it's never just
one player that over a long period of time has the entire market segment and I think, it satisfy everybody's needs
on every dimension.
And so, we have a very deep relationship with NVIDIA. We have for a very long time. And we will for as long as I
can foresee the future. We buy a lot of NVIDIA. We are not constrained in any way in buying NVIDIA, and I expect
that we'll continue to buy more NVIDIA both next year and in the future.
But we're different from most technology companies in that we have our own very strong chip team, and this is
our Annapurna team. And you saw it first on the CPU side with what we built with Graviton which is about 40%
better price performance than the other x86 processors, and you're seeing it again on the custom silicon on the AI
side with Trainium, which is about the same amount of price performance benefit for customers relative to other
GPU options.
And our customers to be able to use AI as expansively as they want. And remember, it's still relatively early days
at this point. They're going to need better price performance and they care about it deeply. And so, I've mentioned
earlier the momentum that Trainium2 has. And I think that for us, as we think about Trainium3, I expect Trainium3
will be about 40% better than Trainium2 and Trainium2 is already very advantaged on price performance.
So we have to, of course, deliver the chip. We have to deliver it in volumes and deliver it quickly. And we have to
continue work on the software ecosystem, which gets better all the time. And as we have more proof points like
we have with Project Rainier with what Anthropic is doing on Trainium2, it builds increasing credibility for
Trainium. And I think customers are very bullish about it. I'm bullish about it as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your
question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Doug Anmuth Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. I'll stick with basically the same topic, Andy. But can you just talk a little bit about
the architecture of Project Rainier and how it's differentiated and what that means for customers and for AWS?
And do you expect Rainier to expand beyond Anthropic? And how do you replicate Rainier with Trainium3 chips?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah. I think what is compelling for Anthropic around Project Rainier is really is the Trainium2 chip, which we built
a very – first of all, we built a very large cluster that they can use in very expansive way. And it's not simple to be
able to build a cluster that has 500,000 plus chips going to 1 million. That's an infrastructure feat that's hard to do
at scale. And so some piece of it is the infrastructure capabilities that we've built over a long period of time in
AWS that is unusual in the industry. But it's just also the performance of the chip and the price performance, both
of which matter.

And I think that Project Rainier is something that is specific for Anthropic, but we have a lot of other customers
who are interested in employing large clusters of Trainium chips that we're going to hopefully give them a chance
to do so with Trainium3.

Operator: And the next question comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Mahaney Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Thanks. I want to ask about two topics, groceries and then how to think about head count in the future. And on
groceries, I want to – the perishables, I think last quarter, you talked about 70% or something of users had never
purchased from – perishables from Amazon before. Just talk about whether you – I think, you used the term,
game changer, before.
Does this mean that maybe we don't – you no longer need to do Amazon Fresh stores. You always had this DVD
delivery van density advantage. And have you kind of reached a point you think of scale and speed that you really
can change people's habit and really have them consider Amazon as one of their first grocery options? Do you
really feel like you're at that point?
And then secondly, just on the head count, given some of the recent news. Just talk to us about how you think
about head count going forward? Are you seeing – is the level of efficiencies that you're getting from AI such that
you can keep head count relatively flattish for the foreseeable future? Just talk about the pros and cons or the
wins and losses in terms of that head count going forward? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah. So, I'll start with grocery, Mark. We have a very large grocery business. If you look at our entire grocery
business, if I don't even count Whole Foods Market and Fresh, in the last 12 months to over $100 billion of gross
merchandising sales, which would make us a top three grocery in the US. A good chunk of it is a lot of the items
that you'd find in the middle aisle so consumables and canned goods and pet food and health and beauty, very
significant and continues to grow at a very good clip.
But then we also have Whole Foods Market, which is the pioneer in organic foods, which is also growing at a
faster clip than most grocery companies with an attractive trajectory on profitability, and we'll expand our Whole
Foods physical presence over the coming years here. And I'm also very excited about this new concept, Daily
Shop that we have, which is a smaller version of Whole Foods in urban settings, which we have three that we've
launched that are off to very good starts that you should expect to see more of as well.
And we have always been – as you referenced, we've talked a lot about having a larger mass physical presence.
And we continue to experiment with various formats. But the one that we are most excited about is what you
referenced, which is the ability to provide perishable groceries with same-day deliveries. And if you think about
how many of our customers are buying from us multiple times a week and who are buying things like shampoo or
detergent or paper cups or water, where the ability to add milk and eggs and yogurt and other perishables to their
order and have it live in the same shopping cart then show up a few hours later, is very compelling.
And we started with a few markets about a year ago, and we were really taken aback at the adoption, not just the
number of people that started buying perishables from us very quickly, but how often they came back downstream
to buy perishables and groceries from us in the future. And so, we've now expanded that to 1,000 cities around

the US and we'll be in 2,300 by the end of the year. And it's really changing the trajectory and the size of our
grocery business.
And I also believe that this many years tradition of the weekly stock up – grocery stock up is changing. And I think
we're a big part of that. And I think there's a lot of potential there for the grocery side. It doesn't mean that we
won't continue to experiment with other physical formats, but we're on to something very significant with what
we're doing with perishables from our same-day facilities
And then on your head count question, what I would tell you is the announcement that we made a few days ago
was not really financially driven and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now, at least. It really – its culture. And
if you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of
locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you
end up with a lot more layers.
And when that happens, sometimes without realizing you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have
who are doing the actual work and who own most of the two-way door decisions, the ones that should be made
quickly and right at the front line, and it can lead to slowing you down. And as a leadership team, we are
committed to operating like the world's largest startup. And that means removing layers.
It means increasing the amount of ownership that people have, and it means inventing and moving quickly. And I
don't know if there's ever been a time in the history of Amazon or maybe business, in general, with the technology
transformation happening right now, where it's important to be lean, it's important to be flat, and it's important to
move fast, and that's what we're going do.

Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Thanks so much for taking the question. Wanted to know, Andy, if you could reflect on the opportunity that's
continuing to present itself in terms of rolling out more robotics and automation and the broader theme of physical
AI across your operations. And how should we be thinking about that as a driver of potential efficiencies, but also
as a driver of the ability to possibly reinvest back in the business over the long term? Thanks so much.

Robotics is a very substantial area of investment for us. We have over 1 million robots in our fulfillment network at
this point. And I would say that while that's significant, we have a lot of invention in flight. So, I expect that we'll
have more over a period of time.
Robotics are very important for us and for our customers and for our teammates because they improve safety,
they boost productivity, they increase speed, and they let our human teammates focus on problem solving and
what they do best. And we expect that our people remain at the heart and the center of our fulfillment network as
they have from when we first started working on robotics.
And we expect that over time, we will have a fulfillment network where robots and humans complement each
other and work together. But I think you're going to continue to see us invest very significantly in robotics. It's

your question.

John Blackledge Q
Analyst, TD Cowen
Great. Thank you. How does Amazon think about agentic commerce going forward? And how do you think
Amazon will serve customers using agents to purchase goods on Amazon in the future? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
I'm very excited about – and as a business, we're very excited about in the long term the prospect of agentic
commerce. And it has a chance to be good for customers, has a chance to be really good for e-commerce. And I
think if you're – if you know what you want to buy, there are few experiences that are better than coming to
Amazon. But if you don't know what you want, a physical store with a physical salesperson still has some
advantages.
Obviously, lots of people do it on Amazon all the time. But you very often want to ask questions and get help
narrowing what you're going to look for. And as you keep asking new questions, having a whole bunch of different
options presented to you. And I think AI and agentic commerce are going to change the experience online where
that experience where you're narrowing what you want when you don't know is going to get better online than it
even is in physical environments.
Now, we obviously have our own efforts here in agentic commerce. We have Rufus, which I talked about in my
opening comments, which is continuing to get better and better and used more broadly. And we have features like
Buy for Me where we will surface on Amazon even items that we don't stock that other merchants have. And then
if customers want us to go and buy it for them on those merchant's websites, we will do that. And both of those
have been successful for us.
But we're also having conversations with and expect over time to partner with third-party agents. And I think that it
reminds me in some ways of the beginning of search engines many years ago being sources of discovery for
commerce. And you had to kind of figure out the right way to work together. And today, search engines are a very
small part of our referral traffic and third-party agents are a very small subset of that.
But I do think that we will find ways to partner. We have to find a way though that makes the customer experience
good. Right now, I would say the customer experience is not good, there's no personalization. There's no
shopping history. The delivery estimates are frequently wrong. The prices are often wrong. So, we've got to find a
way to make the customer experience better and have the right exchange value.
But I do think that the exciting part of this and the promise is that AI and agentic commerce solutions are going to
expand the amount of shopping that happens online. And I think that's really good for customers, and I think it's
really good for Amazon because at the end of the day, you're going to buy from the outfit that allows you to have
the broadest selection, great value and continues to deliver it for you very quickly and reliably. And I think that
bodes well for us.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2025
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed with your
question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Colin Alan Sebastian Q
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess first on AWS, following up there. How much of this acceleration is driven by core
infrastructure versus AI workload monetization? And I think part of it is trying to understand how important newer
services like AgentCore are becoming and bringing enterprises to AWS to build agents?
And then I guess, secondly, regarding the acceleration in advertising, if you could potentially disaggregate the
core advertising contribution versus DSP and Prime Video. That would be helpful as well. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah, I'll start on the AWS side, we are seeing – we're really pleased with the results from this quarter, 20% year-
over-year on a annualized run rate of $132 billion is unusual. And we have momentum, and you can see it. And
we see the growth in both our AI area, where we see it in inference. We see it in training. We see it in the use of
our Trainium custom silicon. Bedrock continues to grow really quickly. SageMaker continues to grow quickly. And
I think that the number of companies who are working on building agents is very significant. I do believe that a lot
of the value that companies will realize over time in AI will come from agents.
And I think that building agents today is still harder than it should be. You need tools to make it easier, which is
why we built Strands, which is an open source capability that lets people build agents from any model that they
can imagine. But even more so, when you talk to enterprises or companies that care a lot about security and
scale. They're starting to build agents, and they don't really feel like they've got – they've had building blocks that
allow them to have the type of secure scalable agents that they need to bet their businesses and their customer
experience and their data.
And that's why – that was really the inspiration behind AgentCore was to build another set of primitive building
blocks like we built in early days of AWS, where it was compute and storage database. We defined a set of
building blocks that you needed to be able to deploy agents securely and scalably that we provide in AgentCore.
And then when we talk to our customers, it really resonates. There is not anything else like it. It's changing their
timeframe and their receptivity to building agents, and it's very compelling for them.
So, I do think the combination of what we're doing to enable agents to be built and run securely and scalably as
well as some of the agents that we're building ourselves that our customers are excited about are compelling for
them. And I think, the other place we see a lot of growth in AWS also is just the number of enterprises who are –
who have gotten back to moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. And we continue to earn the lion's
share of those transformations. And I look at the momentum we have right now, and I believe that we can
continue to grow at a clip like this for a while.
I think on the advertising side that is also an area where I think collectively, we feel very pleased about the
progress. Every single one of our advertising offerings this quarter grew in a meaningful way. I think, there's a few
things going on for us. We have what I think of as a pretty unusual full funnel offering. And if you look at the top of
the funnel, which typically tends to be awareness building and broad scale to be able to use our own Prime Video
and our live sports capabilities as well as going all the way down to the bottom of the funnel at point of sale being
able to use sponsored products, that's – most people don't have a full funnel offering as robust as that.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2025
And then when you layer on top of it, the combination of the audience curation and development we can do, along
with the advantage measurement, it just all leads to a return on advertising spend that's very unusual. And I think,
there are multiple places where we can expect to continue to grow.
One is in our stores business. I still think if you look at the worldwide market segment share of retail, still 80% to
85% of it lives in physical stores. And that equation is going to flip over time. And I think AI is going to only
accelerate that. So, I think we have an opportunity – a significant opportunity still in our existing stores.
And then I think video, we've only been at this for a little bit of time, but it's already a very large amount of
advertising revenue, and we're still relatively early stage. I think that will continue to be a big area of growth. And
then as you referenced, the amount – their demand-side platform or Amazon DSP, that is growing really quickly
as well. Some of it has been – had to do with the fact that we had some features. We always had a number of the
core components people wanted around some of our properties, the measurement capabilities, Amazon
Marketing Cloud, but we lack some features for a while as we were building out our DSP that customers told us
mattered and the team over the last 20 months have closed those gaps in a very significant way so that now
people feel like our DSP is fully featured.
And then you look at some of the partnerships that we've done, the Roku partnership gives us the largest
connected TV footprint in the US. And you layer on top of that, what we've recently done in providing our DSP
customers, the opportunity to integrate with the ad inventory in Netflix and Spotify and SiriusXM, it's powerful. And
so, we are growing very quickly on the demand side platform. So, very optimistic about what we're doing there.
We've continued work to do, obviously, but I don't think we're close to being able grow there.

Q2 2026 Earnings Call 27-Aug-2025
We remain disciplined in driving operational rigor across our business, gaining greater efficiency even as we
continue to invest aggressively in growth. We continue to execute with urgency and focus to capture the
opportunities ahead and sustain durable momentum.
Product revenue for Q2 was $1.09 billion, up a strong 32% year-over-year, demonstrating an acceleration in
growth from last quarter. Remaining performance obligations totaled $6.9 billion with year-over-year growth of
33%. Our net revenue retention rate was a very healthy 125%. Our non-GAAP operating margin increased to
11%, reflecting our focus on efficiency and operational rigor. As you can see, we have continued to deliver strong
revenue growth and healthy result this quarter, and as a result we are increasing our growth expectations for the
year.
At Snowflake, we believe the great technology is defined by the experience of making something complex feel
effortless. And we put simplicity at the center of not just our product design, but our entire customer experience.
We are committed to delivering a cohesive product with fast time to value and it's a differentiator that leads
customers to choose Snowflake again and again.
It's why enterprise leaders like Booking.com on the Intercontinental Exchange used Snowflake. Our platform is
easy to use, connected to enable fluid access to data wherever it sits and trusted by companies of all sizes and
industries. And global hospitality icon Hyatt Hotels uses Snowflake to simplify data management and ensure
unified governance.
By consolidating enterprise data into a single environment, Hyatt empowers its teams with fast, secure access to
information, enabling them to make informed decisions that enhance customer experiences and drive operational
efficiency. This quarter, we delivered on our product strategy, introducing incredible new innovations to drive
value at each stage of our customers' data journey.
Of course, AI is front and center. We are continuing to advance our leadership in enterprise AI with Snowflake
Intelligence now in public preview. This platform enables every user to talk to their enterprise data turning
structured and unstructured data into actionable insights through natural language, and it powers the creation of
intelligent agents directly on enterprise data.
Early adoption is underway with customers like Cambia Health Solutions, which serves 2.6 million members in the
Pacific Northwest. They leverage Snowflake Intelligence to create its first intelligence agent to assist their teams
in improving health outcomes for its Medicare members. This intelligence agent helps Cambia Medicare teams
quickly analyze vast amounts of both point in time and longitudinal data, enabling them to scale their ability to
deliver differentiated, personalized healthcare experiences and ensure members receive the right care at the right
time.
Then there's Duck Creek Technologies, a leader in insurance core systems and analytics, who is leveraging
Snowflake to drive innovation with AI and agentic workflow. They're using Snowflake Intelligence to power internal
teams and increase efficiency across finance, sales and HR, ultimately setting the standard for the insurance
industry. Alongside Snowflake Intelligence, we introduced Cortex AISQL, bringing AI natively into SQL.
Customers can now invoke AI models directly within Snowflake, eliminating data movement and unifying analytics
and AI in a single step.
We have also made great strides to deliver faster, more seamless performance with the launch of Gen2
warehouse. Already, they're helping our customers deliver up to 2x faster performance and greater efficiency,

automatically optimizing resources to accelerate insights and simplify data management without increasing costs,
strengthening the value that our customers see from Snowflake.
With our introduction of Snowflake Postgres, we have reinforced our commitment to developers, enabling our
customers with enterprise-grade Postgres SQL to build and run their most critical AI-powered applications on
Postgres right inside the Snowflake AI data cloud. And we have extended our connectivity platform with
Snowflake Openflow, making it easy to bring in structured, unstructured, batch or streaming data. Built on our
acquisition of Datavolo, Openflow provides seamless access to all enterprise data and now supports change data
capture from Oracle through our strategic partnership.
With customers already using Openflow to unlock new value from their data architectures, Openflow expands our
reach into the $17 billion data integration market. It's also now easier to bring new workloads into Snowflake with
Snowpark Connect for Apache Spark now in public preview. This enables our customers to bring their Spark
workloads directly into Snowflake, eliminating the burden of managing and tuning separate Spark environments.
Customers can now run Spark DataFrame and Spark SQL natively on Snowflake's high-performance engine,
simplifying operations and accelerating time to value. Overall, it was an amazing quarter for product innovation.
In the first half of the year alone, we launched approximately 250 capabilities to general availability, demonstrating
both the pace of our innovation and the breadth of our platform expansion. But we aren't stopping there. As we
innovate, we are continuing to strengthen our platform and help our customers do more with their data to deliver
great business outcomes.
As more companies face the challenge of data spread across different places, we are helping them effectively
share data and collaborate. As of this quarter, 40% of our customers are now data sharing on Snowflake, driving
powerful network effects that strengthen our ecosystem and expand customer value.
We are continuing to see strong adoption of open data formats, especially truly open modern table formats like
Apache Iceberg. We now have over 1,200 accounts using Iceberg, underscoring our leadership in bringing truly
open standards to the enterprise.
Our progress with AI has been remarkable. Today, AI is a core reason why customers are choosing Snowflake,
influencing nearly 50% of new logos won in Q2. And once they are on our platform, AI becomes a cornerstone of
their strategy, powering 25% of all deployed use cases with over 6,100 accounts using Snowflake's AI every
week.
We have embedded AI across the data life cycle to accelerate analytics, transform workflows and even power
migrations. For example, SnowConvert AI uses AI-driven automation to speed up large-scale migrations,
minimize manual recording and reduce risk, helping customers move faster and with greater content.
Cortex AI continues to play a foundational role in enterprise AI strategy. For example, Thomson Reuters is
transforming how its business users easily access information by deploying AI-powered agents built on Snowflake
Cortex Search and LLM observability. This enables real-time insights, seamlessly handles drag and text to SQL
and significantly reduces time to insight and costs across functions like finance and HR.
Then there's BlackRock, which is leveraging Snowflake Cortex AI to help its team serve their clients more
effectively and at a much larger scale. Our technology allows them to pull together every piece of information they
have on a client from their past portfolio and also from a recent call and get instant insight. It's like a superpower
that helps them understand exactly what each client needs so they can provide the best possible service.

We have furthered our AI leadership by integrating the world's leading model in Cortex, ensuring day one
availability of OpenAI's new open source as well as advanced GPT-5 models, providing our customers with
choice and flexibility to leverage their model of choice for their enterprise AI applications.
Beyond what's possible with AI today, we are also making Snowflake the destination for building the next
generation of cutting-edge applications such as Sema4.ai's Agentic AI platform, which helps customers automate
workflows for tasks like supply chain and regulatory compliance.
As we strengthen our platform and introduce new capabilities, we remain committed to scaling efficiently. Our go-
to-market teams are demonstrating renewed focus and rigor as evidenced by our healthy retention rate and our
addition of 533 customers, including 15 Global 2000 companies this quarter.
This year's Snowflake Summit was a clear marker of our momentum. The event, our biggest yet, drew record
numbers of over 22,000 customers, partners and developers from around the world. It underscored the scale of
our community and the excitement around the AI Data Cloud. We are also investing in our partnerships. Today,
more than 12,000 global partners, including leading cloud providers, technology innovators and system
integrators are part of our ecosystem.
We are scaling our go-to-market engine while staying tightly aligned across engineering, product, marketing and
sales. This collaboration enables us to deliver greater value to existing customers, but also win new ones with
speed and precision.
It's a truly exciting time at Snowflake, and I'm proud of the discipline, efficiency and innovation we have built
across the business. We've got a strong operational rhythm. We're investing strategically for growth, and we are
laying the groundwork for continued scale.
Mike, why don't you take us through some of the financial details?

Michael P. Scarpelli
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Thank you, Sridhar. In Q2, product revenue growth accelerated to 32% year-over-year. Product revenue
benefited from strength in our core business. At Investor Day, you heard us outline our four key product
categories: analytics, data engineering, AI and applications, and collaboration. In Q2, new features across all four
product categories outperformed our expectations.
With net new customer adds in the quarter up 21% year-over-year, it is clear that our new customer acquisition
motion is yielding positive results. And in the last quarter, 50 customers crossed the $1 million in trailing 12-month
revenue, a record for the company. $1 million-plus customers now total 654.
Shifting to margins. Q2 non-GAAP product gross margin was 76.4%, non-GAAP operating margin was 11%.
Operating margin benefited from revenue outperformance in the quarter. We are focused on delivering margin
expansion while investing in our business. In Q2, we added 529 heads, including 364 sales and marketing heads.
As a reminder, our sales and marketing hiring is weighted to the first half of the year.
In Q2, non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 6%. As discussed on our prior calls, we expect free cash
flow to be weighted to the second half of the year. This expectation is supported by contracted billings, a large
renewal base and large deal volume in the pipeline.

investments.
Moving to our outlook. For Q3, we expect product revenue between $1.125 billion and $1.13 billion, representing
25% to 26% year-over-year growth. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of 9%. We are increasing our product
revenue guidance for FY 2026. We now expect product revenue of $4.395 billion, representing 27% year-over-
year growth. We expect non-GAAP product gross margin of 75%, non-GAAP operating margin of 9% and non-
GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin of 25%.
Finally, I'd like to provide an update on our CFO transition. We are making progress on our search, and we will
make an announcement once we have more firm details to share.
With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. You

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjit K. Singh Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. Thank you for taking the question and congrats on the accelerating product revenue growth this quarter.
You guys have been executing quite well, and it seems like multiple parts of the equation came to work in Q2.
Sridhar, my question for you is that it seems like modernizing the data infrastructure is a real priority among the
Fortune 500, the Global 2000. I want to get a sense of like as we go through this modernization effort, on the
other side of that, do you see kind of durable growth? Or is this customers addressing their legacy data
infrastructure, maybe you guys benefiting from that migration, if you will. But what is – how do you feel about the
durability of growth on the other side of these data transformation efforts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Well, I think data modernization is just the beginning of the journey, is primarily driven by the fact that legacy
systems have trouble scaling, whether it's workloads or data. And bringing those systems on to Snowflake is step
one in value realization. In fact, the feedback that I get from our customers is that this data modernization journey
is even more important than before because they realize that AI transformation of workflows of how they interact
with their customers is critically dependent on getting their data in a place that's AI ready. And that's where
Snowflake comes in. Data that is in Snowflake is increasingly AI ready, both for access by consumptive layers like
Cortex Analyst or Cortex Search, but also by agentic layers like Snowflake Intelligence, where you can both ask
nontrivial questions. But we fully foresee things like applications coming on top of the data. So we feel very good
that we are very much in the beginning of the journey where data indeed does more for our customers.

Raimo Lenschow Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Perfect. Congrats from me as well. I wanted to focus on the new customer adds. Obviously, great progress there.
I remember last year, the US organization kind of got split into hunters and farmers and that started to contribute.
I think this year, you did it for Europe. Is there already a contribution from the European side? Like can you speak
to that kind of momentum that you have there on that part of the business? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. What I would say is Europe is still developing, but it's contributing. We are laying the groundwork there.
Obviously, we set up this new motion in the US first and the bulk of those new customers are coming from the US
where we've been replicating that setup in EMEA as well as APJ, and we think that will yield as well there, but
they're performing.

Karl E. Keirstead Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Sridhar and Mike, Satya Nadella at Microsoft on the last call went out of his way to highlight an acceleration in
Snowflake on Azure. I'm just curious, as I think through what may have driven the outstanding results this quarter.
Was there anything unique that you did with Microsoft or with customers that are running on Azure worth calling
out? Or did it feel like your outperformance was fairly even across the different cloud providers? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
I would say actually, Azure was our fastest-growing cloud. It actually grew 40% year-over-year. Our customers
running on Azure, and I would say a lot of that is attributable to a better alignment between our field and
Microsoft. We've been spending a lot of time in the last six months there. I would also say, too, that Microsoft is
very strong in EMEA, and we're seeing some good uptick in EMEA in our business as well with some large
accounts that's contributing to that as well. But clearly, the Azure cloud is the fastest growing, but it's off a lower
base. AWS is still the biggest, but Microsoft is moving up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
The only thing that I'll add on top of that is that I think we have both depth and breadth of collaboration. We work
very closely with the Azure teams at an infrastructure level, at the level of OneLake, but also at the level of the
end user products like Office Copilot and Power BI. And the go-to-market partnerships that Mike referenced just
now are an additional accelerant on top of that. We see these as long-term benefits for both the companies, and
you'll see more and more results come out of it in the future.

Q2 2026 Earnings Call 27-Aug-2025
Thanks very much. I'll add my congrats on a great quarter. Mike, it sounds like there were a number of drivers of
the upside in 2Q, especially around some of the newer products that came to market across those four pillars of
growth. I was just wondering, how did you sort of contemplate some of these newer products in the guide for 3Q?
I know you guys tend to want to get a little bit of a trend line going before you want to make any kind of bet on
them. So I was just kind of wondering how they kind of – how that played out in 2Q and how you're thinking about
for 3Q? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Well, as I said, they outperformed our expectations. We did have a modest amount in our forecast for those
because they didn't just come out this quarter. We talked about them at Summit, but we've been working on these
for a while. And when we set our forecast for the next quarter, it's always based on consumption patterns we're
seeing today. And I would say, yes, Q2 surprised us on the upside. We knew it was going to be a strong quarter,
but not as strong as it was, and that's just the nature of a consumption model.

Alex Zukin Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess to the prior question, maybe, if I think about the acceleration in
consumption that you guys are now seeing, is this something where this is a normalization of like the demand
environment, your customers feeling better about spending again? Or is there – and/or is there something more
happening where you're getting increasingly included in these AI initiatives, these AI budgets, these new products
are unlocking incremental budget spend? And if it's the latter, to what extent is [Technical Difficulty] (00:24:37-

Alex Zukin Q

Hey, guys. Sorry, I don't know where I got cut off. But to what extent do you feel as though the outperformance
was kind of a normalization of the demand environment and kind of improved execution from the field versus
getting included in more of these AI-centric budgets and seeing some of these products really initiatives come to
fruition. And if you think about it more of as the latter, how do we think about that as we progress through the year
is starting to drive really meaningful incremental upside on top of previous consumption trends in your customers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Mike and I have talked to this before, Alex, which is that our core business in analytics continues to be strong. It's
the foundation of the company. And you can see this also in things like NRR, net revenue retention, which was a
very solid 125%.

Q2 2026 Earnings Call 27-Aug-2025
What is happening is that there is more and more recognition that the AI components of our data platform can
deliver enormous value. And we are seeing budgets get allocated from large customers for AI projects. And
typically, that also happens when the data is on Snowflake because our customers then realize that the things
that they love about Snowflake, which is the ease of use, the work that they have put into governance to make
sure that only the right people can see the right data, the amount of work that we put into making sure that AI is
trustworthy, all of these play into these large customers choosing us for AI projects.
And for example, of the use cases that were deployed in Q2, close to a quarter of them involved AI in some form
or the other. So this is definitely a trend that will continue. But again, I'll stress something that Mike has said,
which is we forecast as well as we can, meaning that as these workloads become more and more mainstream,
our prediction models are going to pick that up and increasingly roll that into our forecast. But we feel very good
about our ability to create business value with AI and our customers, and that is a trend that we expect to see
both continue and accelerate.

Kash Rangan Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hi. Congratulations. Good to see the reacceleration in product revenue and also net expansion rate. Sridhar, I
had a question for you. We have seen AI in the consumer [ph] realm (00:28:10) just get better and better. Some
would argue the rate of improvement of these models appears to have stalled a little bit, which is disputable. But
at what point are we going to see the AI magic that has taken over the consumer world make its way into the
enterprise? I mean certainly, there seem to be some indicators of that happening at the platform layer. But what
gives you the conviction today more than perhaps at Summit that AI in the enterprise is about to work through
tangible business cases? And also, I was intrigued by your comment on supporting Spark. I mean that confidence
in supporting Spark on Snowflake seems to be a new thing that I picked up. Can you talk more about that as well?
Thank you so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. On the first one, I will definitely say that AI is an emergent and increasingly powerful force. I can speak to it
with personal experience. The kind of questions that we can ask of a sales agent that we developed on Snowflake
Intelligence has become pretty remarkable. Obviously, I wanted to answer questions like get an update about a
customer that I'm about to meet so that my AE does not have to write that particular brief for me. But being able to
do cross-cutting analysis, for example, of the most popular use cases or trends in use cases, questions that I
would normally need to go to an analyst for, Snowflake Intelligence can figure out how to write pretty complicated
plans for these and deliver this. I think that's where you are seeing the magic happen.
And thanks to our partnerships with OpenAI, we launched GPT-5 the same day that they launched it. We
launched GPT-5 on Snowflake. And similarly, with Anthropic, gives our customers the best of both worlds, the
world's best models combined with the data about their business that they have often painstakingly put into
Snowflake. And that's where we are seeing massive value get realized. And that's a little bit of an a-ha moment
for us, for our customers. I'm happy to show off, for example, Snowflake Intelligence to our customers in every
conversation that they have and their normal reaction is that they want such functionality directly on top of their
data as well.
So Christian, do you want to take the Spark question, please?

Christian Kleinerman A
Executive Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah, certainly. So we've talked about Snowpark for many years and how it has been performing well for us. We
outperformed all Spark distributions, managed Spark products out there. And what we heard from our customers
is they will want to simplify the migration effort or cost to be able to get those benefits from Snowpark. Spark itself
has introduced something called Spark Connect, and that is what we've done. We've adopted the Spark APIs, but
the processing happens by Snowflake, specifically by Snowpark. So now you get the benefit of it is a familiar set
of APIs and programming models, but with the performance and cost benefits of Snowpark.

Thanks, Mike. You raised the guide more than the beat this quarter. I'm just curious the visibility and what you're
seeing in the second half.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
I would just say we've consistently been raising by the beat plus more for the last six quarters. And that's based
upon consumption trends we're seeing through literally to today. And consumption is strong within our customers.
You see that in the net revenue retention. And we're seeing a number of our new products with a lot of uptick in
those. And as Sridhar mentioned, we just went GA this year with 250 new features. All these features drive new
revenue for Snowflake, and we anticipate continuing to have that type of delivery of new features going into the
future. That's one of the things Sridhar has really focused on the last year-and-a-half with engineering and
product.

Mark R. Murphy Q

Thank you. The sales and marketing new hires are again just an enormous number for the second consecutive
quarter. I think it's the biggest six months of hiring that you've ever had. Can you walk us through the underlying
dynamic? Does that reflect pipeline growth stepping up proportionately? And where is that going to place
Snowflake in terms of the growth of your quota-carrying sales capacity by the time all of that ramps in 6 to 12
months or however long it takes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. I would say we've actually hired more sales and marketing people in the first six months of this year on a
net basis than we did in the prior two years combined. But I want to remind you that in Q3 and Q4 of last year, we
went through a pretty extensive performance management within our sales organization, in particular. We've
pretty much worked through most of that. But we really look at productivity of reps, and we're really focused on
getting reps and SEs, by the way, too.
We've added a lot more SEs into the organization. We have more specialty sales people within the organization.
And we will continue to add as long as we see that we're yielding the productivity. And it's not just bookings, it's

Brent A. Bracelin Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thank you. Good afternoon. Mike, I wanted to go back to the drivers of upside in the quarter. If I just take a step
back, highest sequential growth in product revenue in 2.5 years, a pretty sharp year-over-year acceleration in
number of million dollar customer adds. How much of the acceleration here in Q2 and surprise was driven by
higher consumption in the core versus an incremental uptake on these new products in AI?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Well, we had some large customers that were doing some migrations of new workloads that drove
outperformance, some very big customers. I would say we saw a little bit of contribution from Crunchy, that
acquisition we did with Postgres. But the newer workloads, we're seeing meaningful contribution as well, too. But
it's really the core of our business is what's driving the significant upside.

Tyler Radke Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. Sridhar, one of the questions we often get from investors just in terms of
framing the competitive environment. Obviously, Snowflake, Databricks, you have the hyperscalers, including
Microsoft Fabric despite your close partnership, Palantir and others. I'm just curious if you are having these
conversations with an increasing number of million-dollar customers. Just sort of how are they bucketing and
thinking about the different swim lanes of these various technologies? And do you feel like there's sort of less
confusion maybe among the larger players such as yourselves that that's helping sort of unlock higher deal flow
and velocity for you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
First of all, Snowflake is the best AI data platform that there is. And this is widely recognized by many of our
customers and new customers. And we stand out in that respect. And the product qualities that we have always
strived to create, whether it is ease of use and simplicity, our connectedness where we don't let silos develop
where data is shareable as it should be or in being a trustworthy platform where we spend a lot of time on making
sure that we reduce hallucinations, work with our customers and having a right governance in place. Increasingly,
these qualities are apparent to our customers.
Yes, there are some areas in which some customers might prefer some of the platforms that you mentioned, but
we feel very good both about our strength in the core, which is around analytics, but increasingly in our ability to

bring new products, whether it is our Postgres offering or Openflow, which is our cloud ingestion platform or
variants of supporting Spark or machine learning or AI. We feel very good and confident about our position and
the value prop that we bring resonate in all the customer conversations that we have, and that's the reason why
you're seeing acceleration across the board both in new customers, but also in things like consumption from
existing customers or how briskly AI is getting adopted.

Brad Sills Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Oh, great. Thank you so much. I see that professional services had a real nice ramp this quarter. I think it's up
20% quarter-on-quarter. What's going on there? Is that just an indication of customers looking to Snowflake for
more consultative kind of strategic deals as you get into all these different types of workloads. We just would love
to get your thoughts on what's driving that and what that might mean as the leading indicator for the business?
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. I just want to remind you that of the – if you look at the total amount of professional services done in the
Snowflake ecosystem, we ourselves do a very small fraction of that. Most of that is being done by the GSIs. We
typically want to be more of the expert services to help other partners do things. And there are some customers
that insist that we are the ones doing the work. And what drove that upside in the PS this quarter was one large
customer where there were some milestones that had to be hit that we were deferring that revenue that we
recognized this quarter because those milestones were hit. If you took that out, it was a normal growth quarter for
services. But our goal is not to do all the services. Our goal is for our partners to be doing those things.

Hey, thanks very much. Appreciate you taking the question. Maybe on the expansion rate, good to see the
improvement there. I'm curious if you think that metric is at all turning a corner with optimizations fading into the
background and consumption trends improving or anything else you'd add around the improvement we're seeing
in Q2 whether that's durable from here and how maybe some of the newer product traction you're seeing informs
your perspective on that metric going forward. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Well, I would say, first of all, we never guide to net revenue retention is really a product of our revenue growth,
and we grew – we outpaced our revenue growth this quarter. So you'd expect that net revenue retention to have
tick back up slightly. What I will say is what's driving that is actually and I mentioned this a couple of questions
ago, we had a number of our large customers that have been existing customers for a while that migrated new
workloads that caused an uptick.
And as a reminder, when people migrate new workloads, it typically causes an uptick in consumption and then it
normalizes thereafter. This has always been the case. And I would say optimizations actually have nothing that

cause anything unusual. We've talked about optimizations before. Customers are always optimizing on
Snowflake. And if anything, we're trying to get in front of these things with customers, so customers don't use
Snowflake unwisely so they don't have to deal with optimizations. And I'm not aware of any customer that's not in
an unhealthy place right now in terms of their consumption, where a number of years ago, we were well aware of
ones.

Michael P. Scarpelli A

number of – some of these are on-prem migrations. Others are from first generation cloud infrastructure from [ph]
Raw (00:42:23), S3 or Azure. So yes, we're getting much better than that, I would say as our SEs, I think are

Hi. This is Joe Vandrick on for Patrick Colville. You guys had a nice quarter landing incremental G2K customers.
Can you talk a bit more about the opportunity that you see in these accounts specifically? And I know you have
654 customers spending over $1 million. Have you guys talked about what percentage of those customers are
G2K? And then lastly, I guess how are your sales reps communicating the value proposition to these very large
customers to drive spending higher? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Scarpelli A
Chief Financial Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Well, what I would say is a Global 2000 customer, there's no reason why the average Global 2000 customer can't
spend $10 million a year on Snowflake, just looking at all the different things, and it can be higher than that. And I
would say don't quote me on this, but again it's roughly 50% of those $1 million plus customers are Global 2000.
And you were asking about how do our salespeople articulate the business value. We spend a lot of time with
sales enablement and educating these people, and we really wanted to be in a discussion about not as what is
the cost of Snowflake, what is the value you're getting. And I would say some reps and teams are very good at it.
Others are developing. But that's really the way we go to market is, what is the business value you're going to get
out of using Snowflake.

are the implications of that like where do those companies – where do the OpenAis and Groks and – where do
they go next? And what are the implications of that for Snowflake and where it needs to go next?

First of all, I think every prediction that we have made about various kinds of plateauing has not really turned out
to be true, some six-odd months later. So I don't think it's quite the case that these models have plateaued along
every dimension. If you think about the increase in code quality that these models have been able to demonstrate,
even over the last six months, it's been a pretty remarkable transformation.
And when it comes to the enterprise, obviously, there's not products that have been adopted at quite the same
scale, let's say, as consumer ChatGPT with its nearly 1 billion customers. But these kinds of experiences become
useful only when the data that matters to the enterprise, all of the PDFs that are sitting in SharePoint or the
various other data sources that there are also become accessible to these models and that's what we have
created with Snowflake Intelligence.
So I think there's ample runway. But I think the remarkable progress is also being made in agentic AI in these
models, learning to use tools of different kinds, I dabble a bit in core generation models and their ability to get
work done has gone up by a pretty remarkable amount again over the past six odd months. And I think you're
going to see situations in which every complicated tasks that humans are involved in is going to have agentic

solutions that are human assisted, where the model using tools does some of the work and then the human guide
the model to be able to be a lot more productive.
So I think from that perspective, it's still very, very early innings. Think of all the work that happens in an
enterprise, whether it is insurance claims processing or regulatory reporting or anomaly detection of various kinds
or even going through the due diligence process for an M&A or a complicated legal thing that you have to do. All
of those are areas where application of data and AI is very much in its infancy. So I think there is honestly years
of work ahead in terms of the value that we can get from AI. The models have advanced so much that I think just
effectively using them in all of the workflows that matter to enterprises is going to create enormous value for all of
them.

Mike Cikos Q
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC
Hey. Thanks for taking the question, guys. I just wanted to come back to the impressive stat that we heard earlier
regarding the volume of accounts which are adopting your AI products and features, I think we're growing call it
mid-to-high teens sequentially here. And I just wanted to stitch together so we have the adoption was great, but
can you discuss what's the monetization strategy that you're putting in place behind that adoption curve? Is the
larger sales effort required on Snowflake's part to ramp the revenue behind that usage? Or how does that play out
from [ph] your seat (00:49:56)? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. We were very deliberate about how we brought AI to Snowflake. We wanted it to feel natural to be a natural
extension of how people access data. I've talked previously about primitives around search and structured data
that was the foundation of how we began to introduce AI. They themselves were useful in that people could
create chatbots on structured data or be able to talk to your SQL as it were to get at – to get a structured data. We
have then introduced higher level constructs that sit on top of it, like Snowflake Intelligence. But one thing that we
were very, very deliberate about was the need for these capabilities to be truly be easy to use and for our
customers to be able to get value very quickly from them or at least experiment with them very quickly. And this is
what has led to the broad adoption, to be honest, without us investing in a massive sales play.
Yes, we have a specialist team but compared to the size of our regular sales team, it's actually quite small. And
so from that perspective, that runs 6,000-odd number, is very impressive. We are now beginning to see situation
in which a product like Snowflake Intelligence is rolled out very, very broadly to the entirety of a workforce. For
example, with the sales data assistant, I want to make sure that it is rolled out to every salesperson and I'd say
beauty of that is all of the permissioning, all of the complexities of making sure the right person has access to the
right information is something that we make very, very easy to implement.
These kinds of use cases are the ones that are going to be driving meaningful revenue for us. And yes, we are
having our specialists focused on these use cases because they're going to drive more revenue, but this is all part
of a very deliberate strategy of creating world-class products, getting very broad adoption and demystifying AI and
then working on use cases that generate massive value for our customers, and in turn revenue for us. And that's
the beauty of the consumption model in that our customers don't have to make some very large commitment to a
project that's not yet delivered value. Yes, they have to go implement a project which we make easy but we may

be – like we make revenue only our customers – when our customers recognize value. So we feel good about
where we are. I think this is the right way to have taken AI to the Snowflake data cloud.

Gregg Moskowitz Q
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC
Great. Thank you. Maybe another question on AI, if I may. We've recently begun to hear, Sridhar, meaningful
customer commitments to Cortex AI. In other words, not just some customers exploring it, but a real uptick in
usage, I know you called out some interesting wins in your script, but more broadly is this consistent with what
you're seeing and if so, it would be helpful to hear a bit more on the primary use cases that you're seeing for
Cortex thus far? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
The primary use case is inevitably centered around a combination of bringing structured and unstructured
information together in a custom repository, for example, as a data agent. I talked about BlackRock in the script, I
think where I said they're creating a little bit of a Customer 360, all of the information that is relevant to our
customer available in a single chatbot. And I use this kind of functionality very frequently, where if I'm going to
have a meeting with a customer. I want to know everything about them that we know, so I'm able to get at what
kind of relationship we have with them, how much we are spending, what the open use cases are, any other
recent notes, workday information about the account hierarchy here that manages them. It is that pattern. It is that
flexible access to data that repeats itself over and over again. And people just apply that in very different ways.
Thomson Reuters uses Cortex to create a set of products for their internal views. They have products for HR
teams, finance teams and so on. I think where it gets really interesting is now in having – in being able to take a
whole set of actions using agentic AI, where in addition to getting information that you want, you're also then able
to say, okay, and now take – like do this update, send an email or update a record in salesforce or some other
actions. I think that's where we are seeing utility get created.

John DiFucci Q
Analyst, Guggenheim Securities LLC
Thanks for taking my question. My question, I guess it's sort of a high level question. Listen, these results are
really good. Everybody has noted that. And you've been pretty clear that you're focused on AI for the future, but
these results are primarily driven by your core data warehouse and analytics business. And we understand why
you're focused on AI and I guess why everybody is asking lots of questions on AI. But I'm more curious about that
core market. There's still a huge amount of this market that's still on-premise. And you have the pole position in
cloud-based data warehouse, you're the pioneer and people love your products. But can you talk about the
sustainability of that market as a growth driver and are there any other solutions on the horizon that keep you up
at night that could disrupt that market, the data warehouse, cloud-based data warehouse and analytics market,
like you disrupted the massive on-prem data warehouse market.

Q2 2026 Earnings Call 27-Aug-2025
I mean, first of all, I should be clear that we have been consistent in saying that it's not an either or, our core
business continues to be very strong, and we have talked to you folks about a number of metrics, including net
revenue retention, which is measured over a two-year timeframe that supports that. And other things that we are
doing, especially in the areas of AI are important because that is where utility is going to be delivered in a massive
way, both today and tomorrow. So it's not the case that we can say we should just focus on our core business
because people that bet on Snowflake are betting on Snowflake for the next five years. And we need to invest in
both.
But to your point about the sustainability of the core analytics market, 100%. I think there is a lot of business to be
had. There are a lot of on-prem systems and part of what we are figuring out in this moment is AI is going to
disrupt potentially everybody, including us. This is the reason why we trust product innovation so much. This is
the reason why, in addition to creating products like Snowflake Intelligence, which are cutting edge, we also
obsessed about how to make sure that our migration technology is the latest and greatest that there is because
being able to migrate legacy systems faster is going to be a significant benefit to whoever that can do that fast.
And that would be my final thing. Yes, there is big market in legacy systems that are going to be migrating or all of
the cloud players, including us are benefiting from that on-prem to cloud migration. But we do really need to
innovate on both fronts to be successful in the long-term.

Thank you. Thank you. In closing, Snowflake is at the center of today's enterprise AI revolution, delivering
tremendous value throughout the end-to-end data lifecycle. Snowflake is easy to use, connected for seamless
collaboration and trusted by enterprise grade performance, driving customers to choose and expand with us. We
continue to execute our scale as evidenced by our product revenue growth and strong outlook for the remainder
of fiscal 2026. And we see a long runway of durable high growth and continued margin expansion ahead. It's an
exciting time for Snowflake, and I look forward to sharing more of our progress in the quarters ahead. Thank you
all for joining us.

Chirantan CJ Desai
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Thank you, Jess, and thank you to everyone for joining. I am honored and genuinely excited to speak with you as
the CEO of MongoDB. This is an incredible company and stepping into this role is a privilege. I want to start by
thanking our customers, partners and employees for everything you have done to build MongoDB into what it is
today. I especially want to acknowledge Dev, whose leadership and vision created a phenomenal company,
which has strong momentum and a tremendous market opportunity ahead. Many have asked why I chose
MongoDB? I had multiple opportunities to lead other technology companies, but MongoDB stood apart.
We are at a true inflection point, driven by major shifts across cloud, data, and AI. MongoDB has the potential to
become the generational modern data platform of this evolving era, an opportunity that comes once in a lifetime. I
am a truly customer obsessed leader. So during my diligence, I spoke with multiple customers. Across these
conversations the message was clear. MongoDB already powers core mission critical workloads for enterprises
that are modernizing their technology stack. At the same time, MongoDB is uniquely positioned at the center of
the AI platform shift.
Few technology companies have that combination of durable core strength and emerging platform relevance.
Throughout my career, I have driven product to platform transformation at some of the most respected technology
companies. Looking at MongoDB today, I see all the ingredients needed to build an iconic modern data platform
company. World class technology, a strong innovation engine, deep developer and customer pool and
exceptional talent. We have everything required to become the generational data platform of choice in the AI era.
Now, onto this quarter's results. Atlas performance was strong, accelerating to 30% year-over-year growth, up
from 29% in Q2, and 26% in Q1. We generated total revenue of $628 million, up 19% year-over-year and above
the high-end of our guidance driven by strength in Atlas. We delivered non-GAAP operating income of $123
million or a 20% non-GAAP operating margin. We ended the quarter with over 62,500 customers, adding 2,600 in
the quarter, and 8,000 year-to-date, reflecting 65% growth in customer additions on a year-to-date basis driven by
the strong performance of our self-serve motion.
Q3 was an exceptional quarter that was driven by our continued go-to-market execution and the broad based
demand we are seeing across business. At the same time, we significantly outperformed on operating margin,
demonstrating that we can drive durable revenue growth while simultaneously expanding profitability. Now, let me
explain why I see such a large opportunity ahead for both core operational data and emerging AI workloads. Our
core business is strong across self-serve and enterprise customers, even before any AI tailwinds. In my first three
weeks, I've met with over 30 plus customers from AI-native companies to C-suite technology leaders at Fortune

500 companies. Those conversations have only strengthened my conviction in MongoDB's opportunity.
Customers already depend on us for mission critical workloads today, and they are leaning in even further betting
on MongoDB to power the AI applications that will shape their future. The expansion opportunity in front of us is
immense. We already serve more than 70% of the Fortune 100, and many of the world's largest banks,
healthcare organizations and manufacturers to run their mission critical workloads on MongoDB.
Even with this foundation, there is still significant room to broaden our footprint within the enterprise. A strong
example of this expansion opportunity is a major global insurance provider that has adopted MongoDB broadly
across its enterprise. The company selected MongoDB Atlas to modernize several mission critical systems,
including its next generation policy administration platform, analytics rating engine, unstructured data repositories,
and hundreds of supporting services. Since moving its policy platform to Atlas, the insurer has expanded from just
a small set of regions to nationwide and significantly accelerated the rollout of new products and distribution
channels. Standardizing on Atlas has given the organization the scalability and reliability to improve customer
experience, support more advanced data and AI capabilities and increase development velocity, all central to its
transformation and growth ambitions.
All of this momentum in the core business is happening before the AI wave has meaningfully impacted our
results. We are still early, but the signs are encouraging. From AI-native start-ups building intelligent applications
on MongoDB to large enterprises developing AI agents that will reshape how they operate. AI applications must
connect what LLMs know with what companies know, which is their proprietary data, systems, and real-time
context. This is fundamentally an information retrieval problem, and it requires a very different architecture than
the last generation of software. Rapidly evolving AI models uncover new, complex properties about entities, and
rigid tabular stores cannot deliver the real-time, high accuracy performance that AI systems require. At the same
time, AI is dramatically increasing the speed at which applications are built and iterated and fixed database
schemas simply cannot keep pace.
This is where MongoDB has a structural advantage. Our document model, natively JSON, is built for diverse,
cross-changing and interdependent data. Our integrated search, vector search and voyage embeddings remove
the need for brittle bolt-ons and we are seeing industry-leading results. Number one on the Hugging Face retrieval
embedding benchmark with voice MongoDB models and the number one vector database on DB engines.
Advances in our embedding and re-ranking models drive meaningful accuracy gains, enabling AI applications to
deliver more grounded responses with fewer LLM hallucinations, while lowering storage cost and query cost
through smaller, more efficient embeddings.
Because all of this is delivered in a unified platform that runs anywhere, customers can keep operational and AI
workloads together, simplify their architecture and innovate faster. As AI adoption accelerates, MongoDB is
positioned not just to participate in the wave, but to help define it. We are already beginning to see this play out
with AI-native customers like Mercor, which is redefining hiring with its fully automated platform that uses AI to
assess and match talent with the opportunities they are best suited for.
Mercor uses MongoDB Atlas to store the AI data behind its platform that directly connects professionals to AI
model training and evaluation roles. Originally a self-serve customer, the company is also utilizing Voyage AI
embeddings and Atlas Vector Search. Atlas has scale to support Mercor's 50% month-over-month growth,
allowing the company to keep its software engineering team lean and agile as it expands to over $10 billion in
value. This is just one example of how customers are building AI-native applications and companies on
MongoDB.

We are also seeing meaningful traction among large enterprises that are starting to build AI applications that have
a material impact on their business. For example, a highly influential global media company aim to increase
engagement via enhanced content recommendation for its vast repository of multimodal assets across its 70-plus
websites. Their existing stack powered by Elasticsearch hit a performance wall, struggling with the complexity of
new embedding models.
Recognizing that rigid systems stifle innovation, the engineering team re-architected on MongoDB Atlas and
MongoDB Atlas Vector Search. Working with MongoDB experts to deliver a proof-of-concept in just weeks, they
integrated Voyage AI models directly alongside their data. The solution scaled effortlessly, cutting latency by 90%,
reducing operational spend by 65%, and driving a 35% increase in click-through rates, ultimately providing
millions of global readers with a seamless, deeply personalized discovery journey.
The bottom line is that the business is performing exceptionally well. Existing customers are expanding with us,
and net new customer additions continue to show strength. Companies in nearly every industry and across every
geography are choosing MongoDB, because we deliver the features, performance, cost effectiveness and AI
readiness they need in single data platform.
Given the continued robust performance of Atlas, along with the healthy underlying fundamentals we are seeing
in the business, we are raising our financial guidance for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year 2026 and
reiterating our commitment to the long-term financial model outlined at our recent Investor Day.
Over the next few months, my focus is straightforward, deepening customer relationships, advancing our
innovation agenda as we build the generational modern data platform for the multi-cloud in AI era, scaling our go-
to-market efforts and supporting our people so they can do their best work.
I believe MongoDB is a company that has only begun to realize its vast potential, and I look forward to unlocking
this potential in the years to come.
With that, I'll now hand the call over to Mike to discuss the financial results and outlook in greater detail. Mike?

Michael J. Berry
Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
Thank you, CJ. I want to extend a big welcome to you from all of the employees at MongoDB. We are excited to
have you join the team. I look forward to working with you to continue to execute on our business plans and drive
meaningful shareholder value. I also want to thank Dev for the partnership and our time working together. I
believe we accomplished a lot in a short period of time and appreciate all of your guidance and leadership. Best of
luck in the next stage of your life journey.
Okay. Now, let's move on to the financial results. I will begin with a detailed review of our third quarter results and
then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2026. I will be discussing our results on a non-GAAP
basis, unless otherwise noted.
As CJ mentioned, we had another strong quarter as we exceeded all of our guidance ranges and are increasing
our full-year outlook across the board. In the third quarter, total revenue was $628 million, up 19% year-over-year
and above the high end of our guidance.
Shifting to our product mix, Atlas revenue outperformed our expectations as year-over-year growth accelerated to
30% in the third quarter and now represents 75% of total revenue. This compares to 68% of total revenue in the

third quarter of fiscal 2025 and 74% last quarter. In the third quarter, Atlas consumption growth was relatively
consistent with last year's growth rates, which drove the acceleration in revenue as well as growth in absolute
revenue dollars for the third straight quarter.
Atlas growth was driven by continued strength with our largest customers in the US and broad-based strength in
EMEA. This strength is being driven both by new workloads and growth of existing workloads. We believe these
dynamics reflect our growing strategic importance to many customers and our ability to win more critical
workloads due to the strength of Atlas. You can see that progress in our total company net ARR expansion rate,
which increased to 120% in the third quarter, up from 119% last quarter.
Turning to non-Atlas, revenue came in ahead of our expectations in the quarter as we continued to have success
expanding within our existing non-Atlas customer base. Non-Atlas ARR, which reflects the underlying revenue
growth of this product without the impact of changes in duration, grew 8% year-over-year.
We continue to see consistent trends in non-Atlas in the third quarter, which reflects the desire of some of our
largest customers to build with MongoDB long term for their most mission-critical applications. We also benefited
from higher-than-expected multi-year revenue in the third quarter as approximately two-thirds of the non-Atlas
revenue outperformance versus the high-end of guidance was attributable to multi-year outperformance.
We had another strong quarter for customer adds as we grew our customer base by approximately 2,600
sequentially, bringing the total customer count to over 62,500, which is up from over 52,600 in the year-ago
period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 60,800
customers at the end of the third quarter, compared to over 51,100 in the year-ago period.
We ended the quarter with 2,694 customers, with at least $100,000 in ARR, representing 16% growth versus the
year-ago period.
Moving down the income statement, gross profit for the third quarter was $466 million, representing a gross
margin of 74%, which is down from 77% in the year-ago period. Our year-over-year gross margin decline is
primarily driven by Atlas growing as a percent of the overall business. Although Atlas gross margins are slightly
below the total company gross margins, they continue to improve year-over-year.
Our income from operations was $123 million for a 20% operating margin, compared to 19% in the year-ago
period. We are very pleased with our stronger-than-expected operating margin results, which benefited from both
our revenue outperformance and lower-than-expected operating expenses.
Net income in the third quarter was $115 million, or $1.32 per share, based on 86.9 million diluted shares
outstanding. This compares to net income of $98 million, or $1.16 per share on 84.2 million diluted shares
outstanding in the year-ago period.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the third quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments and restricted cash.
During the quarter, we spent $145 million to repurchase approximately 514,000 shares, which was executed
under our previously announced $1 billion total share repurchase authorization. Operating cash flow was well
above our expectations at $144 million and free cash flow was $140 million, which compares to $37 million and
$35 million, respectively, in the year-ago period. Our cash flow results were driven primarily by strong operating

profit and improving working capital dynamics, particularly related to higher cash collections. We remain confident
in our ability to drive higher and more consistent free cash flow going forward.
Before we go into our guidance for the rest of fiscal 2026, let me recap some of the enhancements we have made
to our approach to guidance since I joined MongoDB. Importantly, we are providing more visibility into our
expectations for Atlas growth as well as non-Atlas ARR growth each quarter. That being said, we will continue to
be prudent in our forecasting of multi-year deals and only include those deals where we have very clear visibility.
Our goal is to give you a more transparent view into our expectations for the business and our approach to
guiding the non-Atlas business.
Now, let me share some of the assumptions driving our outlook for the rest of fiscal 2026. Number one, we are
continuing to see strong momentum in Atlas, which has experienced relatively consistent consumption growth
through the first three quarters of the year and comparable seasonal patterns as compared to fiscal 2025. We are
seeing strength with existing customers, along with momentum in new accounts as customers large and small
increasingly recognize the strategic value of Atlas. As a result, we now expect Atlas to see approximately 27%
revenue growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026, which is higher than our previous expectations of growth in the
mid 20% range. This outlook reflects our continued confidence in Atlas while taking into account the historical
seasonal variability and consumption patterns during the holiday period.
Number two, we continue to experience steady ARR growth in our non-Atlas business and have good line of sight
to several large multi-year deals we either already have or expect to close in the fourth quarter of the year. Based
on these dynamics, we now expect our non-Atlas business to grow in the upper single-digit percent range year-
over-year in the fourth quarter.
Number three, we continue to make strategic investments in engineering, marketing and direct sales capacity to
drive continued growth. Some of these planned investments have taken longer to implement than expected and
have shifted into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027, which has benefited our operating margin during
fiscal 2026.
Fourth, we continue to make progress on free cash flow conversion, which is now expected to exceed 100% for
fiscal 2026.
Finally, we will continue to execute our share buyback program to help offset dilution from employee equity
awards. In addition to our buyback, this past quarter we began settling the taxes due on the vesting of employee
RSUs with cash instead of issuing new shares. We also expect to receive over 1 million shares of stock for the
cap calls associated with our 2026 notes that mature in January 2026. All of these actions will help us manage
share count for the long term and illustrates our commitment to being good stewards of your capital.
Now let's shift to guidance in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2026. For the fourth quarter, we now expect revenue of
$665 million to $670 million, which equates to 21% to 22% year-over-year growth. We expect non-GAAP income
from operations to be in the range of $139 million to $143 million for an operating margin of approximately 21%.
We expect non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $1.44 to $1.48 based on 86.5 million diluted
shares outstanding.
For fiscal 2026, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $2.434 billion to $2.439 billion, an increase of $79
million from the high end of our prior guide and representing full year revenue growth of 21% to 22%. We are
raising our non-GAAP income from operation expectations by $109 million at the high end and are now targeting
a range of $436.4 million to $440.4 million for an operating margin of approximately 18%. We expect non-GAAP

Q3 2026 Earnings Call 01-Dec-2025
net income per share to be in the range of $4.76 to $4.80 based on 86.7 million diluted shares outstanding. Note
that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2026 assumes a non-GAAP
tax provision of 20%.
While we will provide detailed guidance for fiscal 2027 on our fourth quarter call, I would like to comment on how
we are thinking about a few metrics as we sit here today. First, we remain committed to the long-term model
presented at our Investor Day in September and continue to make great progress against all of the objectives
highlighted at the event. We have seen strong margin expansion and free cash flow performance in fiscal 2026,
and both of these metrics are tracking well above the long-term targets we discussed in September. As we look
ahead to fiscal 2027, we will continue to make strategic investments to focus on driving growth going forward.
With these planned investments and the timing of head count adds, we continue to target 100 basis points to 200
basis points of margin expansion on average and 80% to 100% for free cash flow conversion outlined in our long-
term model.
Second, our non-Atlas business is on track to exceed our prior expectations for fiscal 2026 due to the stronger
performance, including greater than expected large multi-year deals. Given this outperformance and our current
bottoms-up forecast for fiscal 2027, we currently do not expect non-Atlas multi-year transactions to provide either
a meaningful headwind or tailwind to revenue in fiscal 2027.
To summarize, we had another very strong quarter. We are pleased with our ability to drive both revenue growth
across the business while increasing our operating profit expectations and driving meaningful free cash flow. We
remain incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead and we will continue to invest responsibly to drive long-term
shareholder value.
With that, Lisa, we would now like to open the call up for questions.

Q3 2026 Earnings Call 01-Dec-2025
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will be coming from the line of Sanjit
Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjit K. Singh Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. Thank you for taking the questions. Fiscal year 2026 is turning out to be quite the year for MongoDB. So,
congrats to the team all around. CJ, I wanted to start with you since this is your first earnings call. Heard you loud
and clear in terms of what the goal is here to make MongoDB a foundational data platform for the AI era. In terms
of making that happen in your kind of first 45 days on the job, maybe even less than that, are there some initial
things that you're looking at, some kind of things that might fit in the sort of quicker win bucket? And then, longer
term, what are some of the changes you think that the company can make or evolve to, to get to that
[indiscernible] (00:29:35) place in that sort of AI era?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chirantan CJ Desai A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Thank you, Sanjit. This is my day 28 on the job. And I have been speaking to customers as well as our innovation
team, including our Voyage AI team as well as our core database teams. The first thing I would say is the
opportunity for MongoDB to be that data platform for AI workloads is very real because you need real-time
operational data, you need the right context, you need to make sure that you are keeping up-to-date between the
proprietary data of the company, as in the enterprise, as well as the LLM learnings that the LLM model brings to
the table. And most importantly, when I think about all of that combined together, MongoDB has all the elements
needed to be the right foundational platform for AI workloads.
In speaking to customers, it is still early. There are various copilots when it comes to productivity, types of
applications that are happening inside of an organization, whether it's a bank or a healthcare organization or a
manufacturing organization. But what I have not seen is truly AI agents running in production that fundamentally
transform the business or serve customers better. There are many, many pilots still going on. When I contrast that
with the AI-native companies, and there is a really good, fast growth, at scale AI-native company that currently
switched from Postgres to MongoDB because Postgres could not just scale. There is another AI company that
highlighted that is using our embeddings as well as our vector database besides our operational platform.
So, when I combine all this together, Sanjit, what I see is, as truly scaled agentic platforms where you can have
enterprises creating agents that transform their business, MongoDB has a very important role to play; and from a
low-hanging fruit standpoint, I would argue that our embedding model and re-ranking model is something that
customers can start with today. Then they can move on to our vector database and use us for also real-time
operational store. So, that's how I'm thinking. And some of my initial customers' conversations have validated that
theory.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjit K. Singh Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Understood. I know it's early, so great to get that perspective. And then, one follow-up for me, it's sort of a mark-
to-market question. The calendar year 2024, fiscal year 2025 workload sort of improved in quality versus the prior
year. I just want to get a sense of your sort of view on how the calendar year 2025 workloads are shaping up as

they will unlikely a factor in terms of thinking about growth next year. And so, in terms of the quality of the
workloads this year, can you give us a sense of the quality of those workloads?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Berry A
Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. Hey, Sanjit. It's Mike. So, what I'll say there is, as we said during the prepared remarks and we saw this in
Q2 as well, what we're really seeing is strength in the larger customers. It's not only from new workloads, but it's
from the existing workloads. We don't want to bifurcate between which calendar year those were added. What
we'd say is that we continue to see growth in the larger customers. They are growing longer and – they're getting
bigger and growing for longer, which is great. And we're seeing that across both the United States and then
broad-based in EMEA as well. And as Atlas gets bigger and bigger, all of those kind of munch together because
they're expanding, they're adding. So, what we'll do is we'll focus on the growth in our larger customers, especially
in the US and EMEA, without going into each year.

Operator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from the line of
Matt Martino of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Martino Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey. Thanks for taking my questions and nice to see another quarter of acceleration. CJ, I appreciate you're only
a few weeks in, but I'd be curious to hear what customers are telling you is top of mind for MongoDB. What are
the repeated themes in customer conversations as you take a fresh lens to the business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chirantan CJ Desai A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Absolutely, Matt. Great to hear from you. First thing I would say is that the modernization effort, whether it's a
workload that may be just running on-prem in a large enterprise or a workload that is moving to cloud or
sometimes to multiple clouds for resiliency, that transformation in speaking to a large telecommunications
company, a large healthcare company, a large tech company, and I can cite you many other examples, I was
pretty overwhelmed to understand that those transformations are still going on. There is just a recent conversation
I had with CTO of a large telecommunications company who said that they are moving 1,300-plus applications to
another hyperscaler and trying to determine which workloads are best suited for MongoDB.
So, the whole multi-cloud or a public cloud transformation is still going on and just my intuitive sense in speaking
to these customers will be going on for at least next five to seven years. So, that specific TAM still very much
exists for MongoDB. Now, these are the same set of customers, while they are trying to modernize their
application stack, they are also experimenting, I would say, because I have not seen agents at scale that are
customer-facing or sometimes even employee-facing, they may have 10, 15, 20, but not that many compared to
10

Q3 2026 Earnings Call 01-Dec-2025
thousands of applications they run. In those AI applications area, they are experimenting sometimes with our
embedding models or with our vector database or using MongoDB for real-time operational database. So, that
second aspect, which is still fairly early, but we are very well-positioned as you think about AI workloads in
enterprises and large enterprises.
And last but not the least, spending time, as you know or you may know, that I spend half of my time in New York
City and half of my time in Silicon Valley, and speaking to my network in Silicon Valley with AI-native companies
or digital-native companies, what I hear from them is that certain alternatives on relational database just do not
scale because AI workloads are fundamentally around unstructured and semi-structured data. And then, they
decide sometimes explicitly to use MongoDB.
So, I put this in three buckets. One bucket is our core, and still the cloud transformation, digital transformation,
modernization, whichever term you want to use, our core will still continue to grow. As people create AI agents at
scale, MongoDB has a role to play and for AI-native companies and some at scale are already using MongoDB
because the alternatives in relational world just do not scale. So, those are my like three buckets and initial mental
model on how these conversations are proceeding and what we can do for them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Martino Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Really clear. Thanks. Thanks for sharing your thoughts there, CJ. And then, Mike, just a quick follow-up for you. It
was good to see the outperformance on both Atlas and non-Atlas. But with op margins now about 200 basis
points shy of your mid-term framework, how should we think about the philosophy around reinvestment and any
considerations around non-Atlas and the ability to expand margins as we look out into fiscal 2027? Thanks a lot.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Berry A
Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Matt. So, I'm sure everyone's focused on 2027. So, what we'd say is we will guide
2027 on the next call. What we would say is and it's built into the guidance that you have in Q4 and I also talked
about it on the prepared remarks, we are continuing to invest and we will continue to invest. Some of the
investments that we wanted to make, especially around engineering, marketing less so, but certainly around sales
capacity has been pushed into Q4. So, you should expect to see OpEx continue to grow in fiscal 2027, but we
also want to make sure and that's why, Matt, we took the time to say, hey, we want to reorient you to what we
talked to you about in September. We still expect to see margin expansion. But you really see it in the fiscal 2026
numbers is that is coming mostly from revenue growth. That is the expectation next year. We'll continue to grow
revenue, we're going to continue to invest in the business, but the business model will continue to drive that
expansion. So, you should expect to see us continue to invest, especially across those three areas.

Karl E. Keirstead Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Great. Thank you. First of all, CJ, welcome aboard. I'm excited to work with you over the coming years. I
had a question for you. So, it seems as if you're describing these good set of numbers as strengthen the core,
essentially even before that AI tailwind kicks in. I'd love if you could define what you think is fundamentally driving
that core strength. And do you feel like it's possible that actually Mongo is already getting an AI tailwind in the
sense that there's a heightened focus on modernizing your data in advance of AI such that this core strength is
actually AI related.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chirantan CJ Desai A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Karl, great to hear from you and looking forward to seeing you on Wednesday. I would say, the core strength from
my perspective is workloads that are – need modernization has a lot of unstructured or semi-structured data and
ideally suited for MongoDB.
Now, when it comes to AI, could AI potentially drive more modernized efforts? That is possible, but not
deterministic; as in, we see at as we shared in the remarks that in the high-end of the enterprise, the consumption
of the workloads we acquired maybe a year ago, a year-and-a-half ago, that continues to move up in the right
direction as our go-to-market teams are focused on the high-end of the enterprise. We also saw broad-based
strength in Europe. And that is pretty much to the core business like the large insurance company on the claims
engine and other thing that I spoke about related to policies.
So, I particularly see that is, okay, is that – does that mean that if core is modern, it helps with AI workloads?
Absolutely, that is true, because they are not mutually exclusive. And, Karl, one thing I would say, this is my
personal experience in building AI technologies in the past that the AI team is typically a separate team from the
core data team. And AI team relies on the core data team. And if the core data team moves slow, then AI teams
get really frustrated, because innovation velocity is how they measure themselves on.
So, my personal experience was, hey, when the core team is not agile, their schemas are not flexible, it actually
slows AI down. So there is definitely some facts behind your theory that it is potentially the AI revolution, which we
are still in the early stages, is driving modernization in the other part of the enterprise.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Karl E. Keirstead Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. CJ, thank you. And then, Mike, for you. I think everybody on the line appreciates the more definitive
guidance on Atlas for the following quarters. So, thank you. I wanted to ask, what's driving that? Is it simply a
function of you and just in your new – relatively new seats wanting to be more transparent in the guidance? Or,
Mike, is there something actually changing in Atlas such that now that it's at scale, it's becoming predictable
enough that it now makes more sense to give precise guidance? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Berry A
Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
So, thanks, Karl. Thank you for the question. I would say, it's probably a little bit of both. One is, hey, we want to
give you folks a little bit more visibility to what's behind the guidance that we provide. That was number one. Also,
as Atlas gets to be, gosh, now almost a $2 billion business, we feel better about the forecasting. The team has
done a wonderful job forecasting that part as well.

So, when we gave the number for Q4, we want to make sure and give you the visibility. But we also have a pretty
good view of what we hope it would be – understanding that, keep in mind, Q4, we want to be prudent because
there are some seasonal holiday patterns that can be somewhat unpredictable, and we've seen that play out in
the past Q4s. So, I just want to note that for the guidance that we just gave.

Raimo Lenschow Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thank you. CJ, all the best from me as well. I had two questions; one for CJ, one for Mike. CJ, one of the core
things in terms of adoption of Mongo will be on the developer side, because there, at the end of the day,
developers are like a big driver of like what's getting used, et cetera. At the moment, a lot of AI's on the West
Coast.
What's your thinking around like getting AI or getting developer engagement up with Mongo to kind of go against
that Postgres kind of narrative that happens a lot in the Valley.
And then, Mike, for you like, since next year, EA is not seeing benefits for multi-year, should we anchor our
numbers on the ARR performance? And is that the right way to think about it? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chirantan CJ Desai A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Thank you, Raimo. Great to hear from you. I'm going to first ask there is a little bit of historical context in terms of
your point on the West Coast. I'm going to ask our previous CEO, Dev Ittycheria, to talk about reclaim the Bay
initiative that him and the team started. And then, I'm going to specifically talk about how I think about it on the
West Coast.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Hey, Raimo. It's Dev here. As CJ mentioned, we've talked about this in previous calls, but we made a concerted
effort to reinvest in the Bay Area, because during COVID and post-COVID, we felt that we had neglected that
region. And obviously, there was a whole new corpus of AI-native companies are getting launched. So there's
been a real concerted effort, both in terms of putting more feet on the street, putting more marketing efforts in
terms of supporting that part of the world, investing more in the startup community, and also in the venture
community to get people to understand the true value proposition of MongoDB.

We've done things like hackathons and other events in that area as well. And as our team, really focused –
dedicated to really supporting and servicing these early AI-native companies. And that is starting to yield some
results. And we feel really good about the progress there, but I'll let CJ talk about what happens going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chirantan CJ Desai A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Thank you, Dev. And this is the reclaim the Bay in San Francisco area or on the West Coast, it is 100% true,
Raimo, that there is a lot of investment with AI native companies and we could benefit from increased mindshare
and being in front of them as in the developer community that you talked about, which is a super important
community to us on the West Coast.
So, me spending personally time on the West Coast house, I do also have deep network in the West Coast
community, both venture community as well as tech companies at scale, and I already started leveraging that
network to get their feedback. We are really excited in this quarter, as in the 4Q, we are relaunching our
MongoDB.local after a few years in San Francisco on January 15, where we are going to invite companies that
have built on MongoDB. Some great speakers on why they should build on MongoDB and show hands-on
experience to the developer community in that conference on January 15.
And what I see is just speaking to many CEO founders, as well as developers of smaller companies or mid-size
companies, that all these efforts of the marketing investment that Mike and Dev originally approved is going to
start yielding results as we move into the next fiscal year.

Michael J. Berry A

And, Raimo, thanks for the question. It's Mike. On non-Atlas next year, we wanted to make sure we've had a lot of
questions about the multi-year headwinds. So, thank you for the question there. We are not guiding for fiscal
2027. However, sitting here today, I would steer you more towards, if you look at the full-year revenue growth of
non-Atlas, it's about 4%, somewhere in that mid kind of low-single-digits is probably a good range to think about
for next year as we sit here today.

Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great. Thanks very much. Not sure who this is for, but on the commentary around new customer strength within
Atlas, are you seeing new customers ramp faster for net new workloads than they have been historically? And if
so, why?

Brad, my initial observation is that the team – engineering team has done a fantastic job when they launch
MongoDB 8.0 and all the subsequent point releases. That allows Atlas to be adopted faster and remove the
friction whether you are coming via our self-serve channel, or whether you are a large enterprise moving onto
Atlas. So, that's one thing I would say. And I'm going to ask Dev to provide commentary as well from a context
perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dev C. Ittycheria A
Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah, I think what I'd also say is that, Brad, is that I think we've – the self-serve team has really removed the
friction to enable customers to onboard more quickly and more easily. And given the performance – price
performance gains that we've seen in MongoDB 8.0 and now even better in MongoDB 8.2, I think that's really
driving a lot of the traction we're seeing in our new customers. They quickly see the performance benefits and
they're scaling nicely. And so, that's allowing us to continue to acquire customers efficiently.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chirantan CJ Desai A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
And one last thing on that, Brad, if you look at the revenue from that, it hasn't changed materially. It's still, keep in
mind, a pretty small number when they first onboard. So, it's not going to move the needle much. We haven't
seen much change in that cohort over the last couple of years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Reback Q
Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great. And then, CJ, a quick follow-up for you. Philosophically, how do you think about M&A as relates to Mongo?
What types of things, if anything, do you think you need to acquire?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chirantan CJ Desai A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Brad, you know me well. And I'm a big believer in organic growth. The team – Dev and the team have laid a very
strong foundation on our technology platform. I think Voyage AI in February was a brilliant acquisition where we
got unbelievable team in Palo Alto, and my goal on behalf of MongoDB is to always believe in our own teams and
our technology. We participate in a large market and where it makes sense, where we can get a particular
adjacent technology or a great team that can help us accelerate the roadmap, we would always consider that type
of M&A.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Reback Q
Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Perfect. Thank you.

Jess Lubert A
Vice President-Investor Relations, MongoDB, Inc.
Operator, we'll take two more questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Okay. Thank you. And one moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from
the line of Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alex Zukin Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. CJ, maybe for you, I mean, you shared, I think a lot of thoughts about
your initial vision. You shared the three pillars of the core, the enterprise AI opportunity, and the AI natives. I just
want to maybe lean in, where do you see your particular skill set and network offering, kind of not the lowest
hanging fruit, but your ability to make kind of the biggest impact in, call it, the next 12 months to 24 months. Like
where do you really see that incremental opportunity for growth inflection?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chirantan CJ Desai A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
I would say, Alex, and you are aware of the enterprises and the customer obsession I have and the relationships
that I have formed over many, many years with the technology leaders at large companies. So, from my
perspective, there are two areas where I can benefit our go-to-market teams immensely. Number one is Fortune
500, where MongoDB can still penetrate even at a higher rate than it is penetrating today, both within the existing
accounts as well as the new accounts we get. So, that's Fortune 500. And then, I was with our sales teams in
Europe, and there are many customers that they are targeting, including existing customers, large banks,
manufacturing companies, and so on, where they're trying to expand where my personal relationships with those
technology buyers can help.
So, that's bucket number one, is make no mistake, high-end of the enterprise, as in Fortune 500 and Global 2000.
Number two, on the other extreme would be AI-native companies. I lived in Silicon Valley for a very long time. I
understand where venture community is investing. Folks who are creating, whether it's, domain-specific AI
companies or foundational companies have relationships there as well across 101, 280, and 237. And that's
where I also plan to, I would say, plant the seeds in a correct fashion, so that over time, that becomes a
meaningful business for MongoDB if we are the underlying infrastructure for those companies. So, those are the
two extremes that I'm going to spend personally a lot of time on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alex Zukin Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Excellent. And you mentioned Voyage AI, the acquisition this year being kind of a crown jewel in the portfolio.
Maybe just help us understand with the AI native specifically the opportunities there, are those starting, are you
guys landing with Voyage? Are you landing with Atlas? Are you landing with both now at a more kind of constant
pace? Help us understand kind of that incremental differentiator.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chirantan CJ Desai A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. I would say one example and this, in my remarks, I shared that there is a super high growth AI company
that is doing very, very well, and will become a very large company. I have absolutely no doubts about that. They
were not able to scale with Postgres and few other technologies, Redis and so on that they were using, and they

Q3 2026 Earnings Call 01-Dec-2025
moved completely to MongoDB, and seeing that week-over-week and month-over-month growth is super
inspiring. And I spoke to the hyperscaler where this workload is running and they are seeing the same that, wow,
this company is doing really well. So, that's built on MongoDB because Postgres had scaling issue.
The other extreme, I spoke to a fairly successful AI native company that is doing decent ARR, growing very fast.
And when I said, hey, have you consider MongoDB to the Founder, CEO, who is very technical, they said CJ, we
didn't. We built our own vector database and so on. And while I was speaking to him, Alex, about 10 days ago, he
basically said once he looked at the portfolio, he said, let me start with embeddings first, so we are going to try. Of
course, we have to prove it to him why our embeddings improves his accuracy on search and so on, and
improves the performance. So, he said, let's start with embedding models first from Voyage AI. Once that works,
CJ, I'm willing to replace my vector DB that we have homegrown created it with MongoDB.
And oh, by the way, if that works well, eventually I'm willing to swap out my operational database as well and use
MongoDB. So, in those kind of scenarios where they are already on a certain track, we can land with Voyage AI
embeddings. And I'm also seeing in a very large customer of MongoDB, I spoke to somebody who is running the
AI initiatives and they love the Voyage AI embeddings and reranking model, and they've already approved it for
two big workloads. So, we can absolutely land with that is the short answer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jess Lubert A
Vice President-Investor Relations, MongoDB, Inc.
Operator, we'll take our last question.

Chirantan CJ Desai A

Operator: Thank you. And the last question for today will be coming from the line of Ryan MacWilliams of Wells
Fargo. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan MacWilliams Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. The consumer app development environment seems to be getting
stronger as new iOS app development has surged to multi-year highs. We think it's due to agentic coding, and I
know it's early. But on the enterprise side, are you seeing stronger product velocity from your customers in
building their enterprise applications?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chirantan CJ Desai A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
I'm going to ask Dev to provide his opinion, and then I'll provide mine.

Q3 2026 Earnings Call 01-Dec-2025
Yeah. I think what we're seeing is we're clearly seeing a lot of, I would say, prototyping iteration. I would say the
enterprise requirements still have pretty strong and stringent requirements around security, and durability, and
performance. So, while it's – there's a big difference between coming out with a prototype and having a
production grade system that an enterprise can truly rely and trust. And so, there is still a lot of work required to
make those applications enterprise class. But clearly, with the advent of code gen tools, the rate and pace of
software development is only going to increase. And as I think we've said in the past, that's one of the big reasons
why we think AI as a tailwind, is just that the ability to produce more software [indiscernible] (00:58:19) and more
and more strategy is then encapsulated in software. So, from that point of view, we think that's all good news for
us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chirantan CJ Desai A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. And – the only thing I'll add-on is, when I speak to customers who I have been speaking for a long time, in
regulated industries, which is financials services, which is healthcare, which is public sector, the requirement for
an AI agent to be in production versus prototype are vastly different, and they are looking for governance,
auditability, this and that, while the innovation and the need for the speed is very high. So, I have not seen like,
customers will tell me, CJ, I have 10 agents in production, 15 agents in production. And when I really ask them, I
say, are they really customer facing? Can they be audited on the probabilistic outcome they derive? The answer
is, oh, we are still working through that. That doesn't mean that it will not happen soon or it will never happen.
But I still feel we are fairly early and even the environment on which they are building agents, they are telling me,
they try one it doesn't work. They move on to the next one. So, the churn for some of these AI companies that
deliver these tools is also very real. And that's why I'm very encouraged by the MongoDB opportunity. We have
the platform for operational data, we have the best vector database, and we have the embedding models where
they can comfortably at enterprise scale, build a real AI agent using MongoDB platform.

Ryan MacWilliams Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Excellent. Really appreciate that detail. And then for Mike on the Atlas 4Q growth guidance, appreciate the color
there. Just a quick clarification, on this 4Q Atlas guidance, should we expect results closer to 10 or guidance
philosophy consistent with your historical precedent? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Berry A
Chief Financial Officer, MongoDB, Inc.
Yeah. So, thanks. So, I don't want to go into the golf analogy, in this, Ryan, I like hockey analogies better. What I
would say is that, hey, we are – we feel really good about Atlas. It's had a great year so far. We feel good about it
going into Q4. We remain excited about the growth. That being said, we are being prudent for Q4 as a holiday, as
a seasonal holiday patterns. Hey, they can be somewhat unpredictable and we've seen that play out in the past
Q4s. So, what I would is, hey, we just need to be prudent as we enter the holiday season.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our strong results this quarter. We continue to see
healthy growth and momentum across the business, including AI powering new features.
In Search, we saw continued double-digit revenue growth. AI Overviews is going very well with over 1.5 billion
users per month, and we are excited by the early positive reaction to AI Mode. There's a lot more to come ahead.
In subscriptions, we surpassed 270 million paid subscriptions with YouTube and Google One as key drivers. And
Cloud grew rapidly with significant demand for our solutions, and you saw our leadership in AI at Cloud Next
across infrastructure, agents and more. Our differentiated full stack approach to AI continues to be central to our
growth.
This quarter was super exciting as we rolled out Gemini 2.5, our most intelligent AI model, which is achieving
breakthroughs in performance and it's widely recognized as the best model in the industry. That's an
extraordinary foundation for our future innovation, and we are focused on bringing this to people and customers
everywhere.
Looking ahead to I/O, Brandcast and Google Marketing Live, I can't wait for our teams to showcase the
innovations they've been working on. Turning to our AI progress this quarter, which continues to enable significant
growth opportunities. The elements of the AI stack I've previously mentioned are AI infrastructure, world-class
research, including models and tooling; and our products and platforms.
Starting with AI infrastructure, our long-term investments in our global network have positioned us well. Google's
network is robust and resilient, supported by over 2 million miles of fiber and 33 subsea cables. Complementing
this, we offer the industry's widest range of TPUs and GPUs, and continue to invest in next-generation
capabilities.
Ironwood, our seventh-generation TPU and most powerful to date is the first designed specifically for inference at
scale. It delivers more than 10x improvement in compute power over our recent high-performance TPU, while
being nearly twice as power efficient.
Our strong relationship with NVIDIA continues to be a key advantage for us and our customers. We were the first
cloud provider to offer NVIDIA's groundbreaking B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs, and will be offering their next-
generation Vera Rubin GPUs.
Second, this infrastructure powers our world-class research, including our industry-leading models. We released
Gemini 2.5 Pro last month, receiving extremely positive feedback from both developers and consumers. 2.5 Pro is
state-of-the-art on a wide range of benchmarks and debuted at number one on the Chatbot Arena by a significant
margin. 2.5 Pro achieved big leaps in reasoning, coding, science, and math capabilities, opening up new
possibilities for developers and customers. Active users in AI Studio and Gemini API have grown over 200% since
the beginning of the year.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2025
And last week, we introduced 2.5 Flash, which enables developers to optimize quality and cost.
Our latest image and video generation models, Imagen 3 and Veo 2, are rolling out broadly and are powering
incredible creativity.
Turning to open models, we launched Gemma 3 last month, delivering state-of-the-art performance for its size.
Gemma models have been downloaded more than 140 million times.
Lastly, we're developing AI models in new areas where there's enormous opportunity. For example, our new
Gemini Robotics models.
And in health, we launched AI Co-Scientist, a multi-agent AI research system, while AlphaFold has now been
used by over 2.5 million researchers.
Third, turning to products and platforms, all 15 of our products with a half billion users now use Gemini models.
Android and Pixel are two examples of how we're putting the best AI in people's hands, making it super easy to
use AI for a wide range of tasks, just by using their camera, voice or taking a screenshot.
We're upgrading Google Assistant on mobile devices to Gemini, and later this year we'll upgrade tablets, cars and
devices that connect to your phone, such as headphones and watches.
The Pixel 9a launched to very strong reviews, providing the best of Google's AI offerings, like Gemini Live and AI-
powered camera features. And Gemini Live camera and screen sharing is now rolling out to all Android devices,
including Pixel and Samsung S25.
Now, moving on to key highlights from across Search, Cloud, YouTube, and Waymo.
First Search, AI is one of the most revolutionary technologies for enabling and expanding our information mission.
And for Search we see it growing the number and types of questions we can answer. We're already seeing this
with AI Overviews, which now has more than 1.5 billion users every month.
Nearly a year after we launched AI Overviews in the US, we continue to see that usage growth is increasing as
people learn that Search is more useful for more of their queries. So, we're leaning in heavily here, continuing to
roll the feature out in new countries, to more users, and to more queries.
Building on the positive feedback for AI Overviews, in March we released AI Mode, an experiment in Labs. It
expands what AI Overviews can do with more advanced reasoning, thinking and multimodal capabilities to help
with questions that need further exploration and comparisons.
On average, AI Mode queries are twice as long as traditional Search queries. We are getting really positive
feedback from early users about its design, fast response time, and ability to understand complex, nuanced
questions.
We also continue to see significant growth in multi-modal queries: Circle to Search is now available on more than
250 million devices, with usage increasing nearly 40% this quarter. And monthly visual searches with Lens have
increased by 5 billion since October.

Moving on to Cloud. At Cloud Next, we announced major innovations, and over 500 companies shared the
business results they are achieving by working with us. We provide leading cost, performance, and reliability for
AI training and inference. This enables us to deliver the best value for AI leaders, like Anyscale and Contextual AI,
as well as global brands like Verizon. And for highly sensitive data and regulatory requirements, Google
Distributed Cloud and our Sovereign AI make Gemini available on premises or in country.
Our Vertex AI Platform makes over 200 foundation models available, helping customers like Lowe's integrate AI.
We offer industry leading models, including: Gemini 2.5 Pro, 2.5 Flash, Imagen 3, Veo 2, Chirp, and Lyria. Plus
open source and third-party models like Llama 4 and Anthropic.
We are the leading cloud solution for companies looking to the new era of AI agents, a big opportunity. Our Agent
Development Kit is a new open-source framework to simplify the process of building sophisticated AI agents and
multi-agent systems. And Agent Designer is a low code tool to build AI agents and automate tasks in over 100
enterprise applications and systems.
We are putting AI agents in the hands of employees at major global companies, like KPMG. With Google
Agentspace, employees can find and synthesize information from within their organization, converse with AI
agents, and take action with their enterprise applications. It combines Enterprise Search, Conversational AI or
Chat, and access to Gemini and third-party Agents. We also offer prepackaged agents across customer
engagement, coding, creativity and more that are helping to provide conversational customer experiences,
accelerate software development, and improve decision-making.
And of course, Google Workspace, it delivers more than 2 billion AI assists monthly, including summarizing Gmail
and refining Docs.
Lastly, our cybersecurity products are helping organizations detect, investigate, and respond to cybersecurity
threats. Our expertise, coupled with integrated Gemini AI advances, detects malware, prioritizes threats, and
speeds up investigative workflows.
This quarter, we were excited to announce our intent to acquire Wiz, a leading cloud security platform that
protects all major clouds and code environments. Together we can make it easier and faster for organizations of
all types and sizes to protect themselves, end-to-end and across all major clouds. We think this will help spur
more multi-cloud computing, something customers want.
Next, YouTube. Yesterday marked a historic milestone, the 20th anniversary of the first video uploaded to
YouTube. From that single, 19-second upload, the platform has grown into a global phenomenon, fundamentally
changing how billions of people create, share, and experience content.
Through all this growth, subscriptions are now a big part of the business. We continue to diversify subscription
options, recently expanding our Premium Lite pilot to the US, giving users a new way to enjoy most videos on
YouTube ad-free.
TV is the primary device for YouTube viewing in the US. According to Nielsen, YouTube has been number one in
streaming watch time in the US for the last two years. And YouTube now has over 1 billion monthly active podcast
users.
YouTube Music and Premium reached over 125 million subscribers, including trials, globally.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2025
And finally, Waymo is now safely serving over a quarter of a million paid passenger trips each week. That's up 5x
from a year ago.
This past quarter Waymo opened up paid service in Silicon Valley. Through our partnership with Uber, we
expanded in Austin and are preparing for our public launch in Atlanta later this summer. We recently announced
Washington, DC, as a future ride-hailing city, going live in 2026 alongside Miami. Waymo continues progressing
on two important capabilities for riders, airport access and freeway driving.
Thanks to all of our employees for their work this quarter; it was a great start to the year and Q2 will be even more
exciting.
With that, Philipp, over to you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philipp Schindler
Chief Business Officer & Senior Vice President, Google, Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. I'll quickly cover performance for the quarter and then frame the rest of my
remarks around the progress we are delivering across Search, Ads, YouTube and partnerships.
Google Services revenues were $77 billion for the quarter, up 10% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in
Search and YouTube, partially offset by year-on-year decline in network revenues.
To add some further color to the performance, the 10% increase in Search and other revenues was led by
financial services, primarily due to strength in insurance followed by retail. YouTube saw a similar performance
across verticals. Its 10% growth in advertising revenues was driven by direct response followed by brand.
So, let's start with Search, where we've seen robust growth in revenues. All around the world, over 2 billion
people use Search every day to find information, compare products or shop. And there are more than 5 trillion
searches on Google annually.
We've continued our efforts to help more people ask entirely new questions, bringing more opportunities for
businesses to connect with consumers. And as we've mentioned before, with the launch of AI Overviews, the
volume of commercial queries has increased.
Q1 marked our largest expansion to date for AI Overviews, both in terms of launching to new users and providing
responses for more questions. The feature is now available in more than 15 languages across 140 countries. For
AI Overviews, overall, we continue to see monetization at approximately the same rate, which gives us a strong
base in which we can innovate even more.
Turning to visual queries. On the last earnings call, I mentioned the success we're seeing with Lens, where
shoppers use their camera or images to quickly find information in ways they couldn't before. In Q1, the number of
people shopping on Lens grew by over 10%, and the majority of Lens queries are incremental. Sundar mentioned
the significant growth we're also seeing with Circle to Search as multi-modality continues to drive queries across
Search.
Moving to Ads. More businesses, big and small, are adopting AI powered campaigns, and the deployment of AI
across our Ads business is driving results for our customers and for our business. Throughout 2024, we launched
several features that leverage LLMs to enhance advertiser value, and we're seeing this work pay off. The

combination of these launches now allows us to match ads to more relevant search queries. And this helps
advertisers reach customers and searches where we would not previously have shown their ads.
Focusing on our customers, we continue to solve advertisers' pain points and find opportunities to help them
create, distribute and measure more performant ads, infusing AI at every step of the marketing process.
On Audience Insights, we released new asset audience recommendations, which tell businesses the themes that
resonate most with their top audiences.
On creatives, advertisers can now generate a broader variety of lifestyle imagery customized to their business to
better engage their customers and use them across PMax, Demand Gen, display and app campaigns.
Additionally, in PMax, advertisers can automatically source images from their landing pages and crop them,
increasing the variety of their assets.
On media buying, advertisers continue to see how AI-powered campaigns help them find new customers. In
Demand Gen, advertisers can more precisely manage ad placements across YouTube, Gmail, Discover and
Google Display Network globally and understand which assets work best at a channel level.
Thanks to dozens of AI powered improvements launched in 2024, businesses using Demand Gen, now see an
average 26% year-on-year increase in conversions per dollar spend for goals like purchases and leads. And
when using Demand Gen with product feed, on average, they see more than double the conversion per dollar
spent year-over-year.
As an example, Royal Canin combined Demand Gen and PMax campaigns to find more customers for its cat and
dog food products. The integration resulted in a 2.7 times higher conversion rate, a 70% lower cost per acquisition
for purchases and increased the value per user by 8%.
Turning to YouTube, where we saw strong growth in revenues across ads and subscriptions. This week we're
celebrating YouTube's 20th anniversary. We are proud of its leadership as a streaming destination where people
come to watch everything they love, from live sports and creator produced content to shorts and podcasts.
Creators are what drives viewership and on average they upload 20 million videos a day to YouTube.
Our biggest creators generate a level of fandom and viewer engagement around large cultural moments on
YouTube that brands can't find anywhere else. During March Madness, brands aligned not only with clips and
highlights from the game, but also with the creators who drive basketball culture like Jesser and the Ringer's J.
Kyle Mann. In Q1, the growth of our reservation-based ads business more than doubled year-over-year.
Brands and creators continue to use the opportunities that collaborations and partnerships offer. Toyota worked
with Zach King, the king of short magical videos with over 42 million followers to take over his channel. The
creator takeover and accompanying creator ad lifted Toyota's brand awareness by 25% compared to control
group and 9% compared to the Toyota brand ad.
Looking at shorts, engaged views grew by over 20% in the first quarter. We continue to be pleased with the
progress we're making globally in Shorts monetization relative to in-stream viewing and are particularly
encouraged by the trend in the US.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2025
As always, I'll wrap up with the strong momentum we're seeing in partnerships where customers increasingly
recognize the strength and breadth of what Google has to offer. For instance, Roblox is partnering with Google Ad
Manager to bring immersive ads to gamers.
Gen Z gamers are Roblox's biggest users and thanks to our partnership, advertisers will be able to reach its
audience with ads that blend seamlessly into the gaming experience. We also launched a YouTube Shorts effect
to help people release iconic Roblox ads and inspire fans to create content at scale.
In closing, I'd like to thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions and commitment to our success, and to our
customers and partners for their continued trust.
Anat, over to you.

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President-Google, Alphabet, Inc.
Thank you, Philipp. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I state
otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level and will then cover our segment results. I'll end with some
commentary on our outlook for the second quarter and 2025.
We had another strong quarter in Q1, consolidated revenues of $90.2 billion, increased by 12%, or 14% in
constant currency. Search and YouTube Advertising, subscription platforms and devices and Google Cloud each
had double-digit revenue growth this quarter, reflecting strong momentum across the business.
Total cost of revenue was $36.4 billion, up 8%. TAC was $13.7 billion, up 6%. We continue to see a revenue mix
shift with Google Search growth at double-digit levels while network revenues, which have much higher TAC rate
declined. Other cost of revenue was $22.6 billion, up 9%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition
costs, largely for YouTube, followed by depreciation and other technical infrastructure operations costs.
Total operating expenses increased 9% to $23.3 billion. R&D investments increased by 14%, primarily driven by
increases in compensation and depreciation expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased 4%, primarily
reflecting a decline in compensation expenses.
G&A expenses increased by 17%, reflecting the impact of charges for legal and other matters. Operating income
increased 20% this quarter to $31 billion, and operating margin increased to 33.9%, representing 2.3 points of
margin expansion.
Operating margin benefited from healthy revenue growth, a moderated pace of compensation growth and a
favorable mix shift towards lower TAC advertising revenues, partially offset by year-on-year increase in
depreciation expenses of just over $1 billion. Other income and expenses was $11.2 billion, primarily due to
unrealized gain on our non-marketable equity securities related to our investment in a private company, which we
noted in our 10-K is a subsequent event.
Net income increased 46% to $34.5 billion and earnings per share increased 49% to $2.81. We delivered free
cash flow of $19 billion in the first quarter and $74.9 billion for the trailing 12-months. We ended the quarter with
$95 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Turning to segment results. Google Services revenues increased 10% to $77.3 billion, reflecting strength in
Google Search and YouTube Advertising and subscription. Google Search and other advertising revenues

increased by 10% to $50.7 billion. The robust performance of Search was once again broad-based across
verticals led by financial services, due primarily to strength in insurance followed by retail.
YouTube Advertising revenues increased 10% to $8.9 billion, driven by direct response advertising followed by
brand. Network advertising of $7.3 billion were down 2%. Subscription platforms and device revenues increased
19% to $10.4 billion, primarily reflecting growth in subscription revenues. This growth was primarily driven by
YouTube subscription offerings followed by Google One, with growth in the number of subscribers being the
biggest driver of revenue growth. Google Services operating income increased 17% to $32.7 billion and operating
margin increased from 39.6% to 42.3%.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment, which continued to deliver very strong results this quarter. Revenue
increased by 28% to $12.3 billion in the first quarter reflecting growth in GCP across core and AI products at a
rate that was much higher than Cloud's overall revenue growth rate. Growth in Google Workspace was primarily
driven by an increase in average revenue per seat.
Google Cloud operating income increased to $2.2 billion and operating margin increased from 9.4% to 17.8%. As
we scale our fleet, we continue to focus on driving improvements in productivity, efficiency and utilization to offset
the growth in expenses, particularly from higher depreciation.
As to other bets, for the first quarter, revenues were $450 million, and operating loss was $1.2 billion. The year-
on-year decline in revenue and increase in operating loss primarily reflect the milestone payment received in the
first quarter of 2024 for one of our other bets.
With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the first quarter was $17.2 billion, primarily reflecting investment in
our technical infrastructure with the largest component being investment in servers, followed by data centers to
support the growth of our business across Google Services, Google Cloud and Google DeepMind.
In Q1, we returned value to shareholders in the form of $15.1 billion in share repurchases and $2.4 billion in
dividend payments. As we announced today, our board of directors declared a 5% increase in our quarterly
dividend and also approved a new $70 billion share repurchase authorization.
Turning to our outlook, I would like to provide some commentary on several factors that will impact our business
performance in the second quarter and the remainder of 2025.
First, in terms of revenue, I'll highlight a couple of items that we mentioned last quarter that will have an impact on
second quarter and 2025 revenue. First, in Google Services, advertising revenue in 2025 will be impacted by
lapping the strength we experienced in the financial service vertical throughout 2024.
Second, in Cloud, we're in a tight demand supply environment and given that revenues are correlated with the
timing of deployment of new capacity, we could see variability in Cloud revenue growth rates depending on
capacity deployment each quarter. We expect relatively higher capacity deployment towards the end of 2025.
Moving to investments starting with our expectation for CapEx, for the full year 2025, we still expect to invest
approximately $75 billion in CapEx this year. The expected CapEx investment level may fluctuate from quarter-to-
quarter due to the impact of changes and the timing of deliveries and construction schedules.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2025
In terms of expenses, first, as I mentioned on our previous earnings call, the significant increase in our
investments in CapEx over the past few years will continue to put pressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of
higher depreciation.
In the first quarter, we saw 31% year-on-year growth in depreciation from the increase in technical infrastructure
assets placed in service. Given the increase in CapEx investments over the past few years, we expect the growth
rate in depreciation to accelerate throughout 2025.
Second, as we've previously said, we expect some head count growth in 2025 in key investment area. As we
disclosed previously, due to a shift in the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards
beginning in 2023, our first quarter stock-based comp expenses is relatively lower compared to the remaining
quarters of the year.
In conclusion, as you heard from Sundar and Philipp, we're pleased with the progress we're making across the
organization, the results for the quarter and the opportunities ahead.
Our success as a company is grounded in our experience driving advancements in deep computer science that
enables us to create innovative new products and services for users, businesses and partners around the world.
We have a strong track record of incubating and then building these offerings into new, profitable businesses for
Alphabet. As we announced last quarter, YouTube and Cloud exited 2024 at a combined annual run rate of $110
billion.
And as you heard from Sundar earlier, Waymo has continued to progress in building on its impressive
technological achievements to scale rapidly and develop a sustainable business model. Thank you.
Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan
Stanley. Your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Nowak Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on, sort of, the macro advertising backdrop,
maybe – and I know it's April 24, and you called out some factors, as you're kind of thinking about the second
quarter. Any other factors you're seeing in advertising verticals or regions or categories that could be showing any
signs of weakness quarter-to-date, we should think through any other changes from typical seasonality in 2Q
2025 versus prior quarters?
Then the second one, and Philipp, I think I heard you mention how the volume of commercial queries has
increased. Maybe can you just walk us through which of the products are driving that increase in commercial
queries. And as you sort of think about the pipeline of Search products, are there any others that you're
particularly excited about to kind of continue to drive further commercial query growth throughout 2025, 2026?
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
So, let me take the first one as well. We saw broad-based strength across ad verticals in Q1, and we saw it – give
you a bit of vertical color here. Search was led again, by finance, due primarily to ongoing strength in the
insurance, retail, healthcare and travel were actually also sizable contributors here to growth.
With regard to Q2, we're only a few weeks in, so it's really too early to comment. I mean we're obviously not
immune to the macro environment. But we wouldn't want to speculate about potential impacts beyond noting that
the changes to the de minimis exemption will obviously cause a slight headwind to our Ads business in 2025,
primarily from APAC-based retailers.
And maybe to zoom out, I would say we have a lot of experience in managing through uncertain times, and we
focus on helping our customers by providing deep insights into changing consumer behavior that is relevant to
their business. Examples are auction dynamics, query trend insights on topics like replacement purchases and so
on. So, we have a lot of experience in this area.
On the commercial query side, look, AI Overviews continue to drive higher satisfaction and Search usage. And as
I noticed, Q1 was really our largest expansion to date for AI Overviews, both in terms of launching to new users
and providing responses for more questions. And that's really the core already of the answer. AI Overviews sits at
the center of your question here. And when it comes to other products, look, I don't want to speculate on this, but
we're happy with what we're seeing here in AI Overviews, and I'm confident we can expand this to more products
over time.

Doug Anmuth Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Philipp, maybe just to go back to AI Overviews for a moment. Can you just
tell us how we should think about the $1.5 billion AI Overviews users just in terms of breadth of rollout? And I
know you're seeing monetization at approximately the same rate. But what does that mean in terms of click-
through rates and conversion?
And then Anat, just curious if there have been any changes to Google's approach to durably reengineering the
cost base since you've joined? And if macro weakens, and you see more of a slowdown, would you expect to find
additional opportunities to cut back more on costs? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philipp Schindler A
Chief Business Officer & Senior Vice President, Google, Alphabet, Inc.
Yeah. Look, on the Ads, in AI Overviews, late last year, actually, we launched them within the AI Overviews on
mobile in the US. And this builds on our previous rollout of Ads above and below, so this was a change that we
have.
But as I talked about it before, for AI Overviews, overall, we see the monetization at approximately the same rate,
which gives us a strong base on which we can innovate even more. So, I'm very happy with this. I don't think this
is the moment to go into the details of click-through rates and conversion and so on. But overall, we're happy with
what we're seeing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anat Ashkenazi A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President-Google, Alphabet, Inc.
And to your question on our approach to productivity and efficiency, it hasn't really changed. I've mentioned my
approach and our approach as a company at the end of 2024. And we're still focused on driving efficiency and
productivity throughout the organization, both in our operating expenses and in our CapEx. I've mentioned some
of these on my – during my prepared remarks.
But certainly, this helps us as we think about the investments we need to make in innovation to drive long-term
sustainable growth profile for the company, we're able to repurpose some of these efficiencies into these
investments as well as, as you think about the increase in CapEx we've seen over the past several years and
what we're investing this year, this will put additional pressure on the income statement in the form of
depreciation. So we're working hard to try and offset some of the headwinds.
As well as within the CapEx investments themselves, $75 billion, we're looking at how do we make sure every
dollar is used efficiently. We have a highly rigorous process, to determine the demand behind it and then the
allocation of the compute associated with our technical infrastructure investments, ensuring that we're utilizing
that appropriately and that we're highly efficient with everything we're doing.
You've seen some of the announcement and some of the changes but we're focusing on continuing to moderate
the pace of compensation growth, looking at real estate footprint and again, the build-out and utilization of our
technical infrastructure across the business.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric J. Sheridan Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Thank you for taking the questions. First, maybe for Sundar. When you look across the consumer AI landscape
today, how are you thinking about continuing to drive differentiation for Gemini as a platform through the lens of
usage, utility or putting product innovation at the forefront of driving consumer habits?
And then the second one, maybe for Anat, if the macro environment were to change and become more
downwardly volatile, how should investors think about the investments that are must make this year, almost fixed
in nature versus where there might be more flexibility to alter the investment priorities of the company if the macro
environment were to worsen? Thank you so much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks, Eric. Obviously, it's an exciting moment on the AI front. I think the foundation for everything is obviously
the Frontier Model progress we are seeing, and particularly with 2.5 Pro and Flash. I think we're well positioned.
We are seeing tremendous reception from developers, enterprises and consumers too.
And obviously, we are delivering consumer AI experiences across our product portfolio, including the primary way
people experience it is obviously in Search with AI Overviews and very early days with AI Mode, but that will be a
consumer AI Forward experience. And we're already seeing very positive feedback. Queries are – people are
typing in roughly 2x longer queries compared to a traditional search. So there's a lot of excitement there.
And in the Gemini app, which you asked about, we've really seen increased momentum, particularly over the last
few weeks as we've rolled out not just the newer models, but we are seeing users are really responding well to all
the innovation at Gemini Live, which is based on Project Astra has been very well received, deep research I think
based on 2.5 Pro is SOTA and that's been well received. In Canvas, we've had a lot of traction as well. And so we
are definitely investing more. We have recently organized ourselves better to capitalize on this momentum, and
I'm excited about our roadmap there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anat Ashkenazi A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President-Google, Alphabet, Inc.
And on the investments this year and overall, should there be any macroeconomic changes, as I said, we're still
planning to invest approximately $75 billion in CapEx this year. We do see a tremendous opportunity ahead of us
across the organization, whether it's to support Google Services, Google Cloud and Google DeepMind. Recall I've
stated on the Q4 call that we exited the year in cloud specifically with more customer demand than we had
capacity. And that was the case this quarter as well. So we want to make sure we ramp up to support customer
needs and customer demands.
Having said that, we're investing in long term, and we're investing in innovation. That's the essence of our
business. And we want to do it in a responsible fashion. So you've seen us over the past couple years, and we're
continuing to do this, and you're seeing this in our results, drive efficiency and productivity throughout the
business. And we've announced things such as consolidation of teams, which helps not just with cost, but with
velocity and speed. We're able to get things to market faster. So that's one of the areas we're focused on. You
heard from Sundar in the last couple of calls and just a rapid pace of innovation we're bringing to the marketplace.

So the way we're doing this across the business to drive productivity and efficiency should help us have a more
resilient organization irrespective of macroeconomic condition. But certainly, we don't ignore that. We always look
at what's happening outside the organization as well as inside but invest appropriately to drive both the short-term
growth as well as the long-term growth.

Ross Sandler Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. Thanks. One for Sundar, one for Philipp. Sundar, it was disclosed this week in the trial that's going on that
Gemini has 35 million DAUs. And just curious, that number obviously trails ChatGPT by a pretty wide margin.
Could you talk about the strategy to get that DAU figure much higher that you guys are deploying?
And then Philipp, just curious to hear what you're seeing on the brand advertising side at YouTube in 1Q and into
early 2Q. Are brands holding up relatively well, like direct response? Are they starting to react to some of these
macro jitters that we're all experiencing? Any thoughts there? Thank you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks, Ross. I think I touched upon this to Eric's question as well, but we are definitely – I think there's been a
lot of momentum in terms of product features we've been introducing, and we are definitely seeing reception,
including increased adoption and usage based on those features. So I think we are in a good positive cycle. The
recent advances on the model Frontier. By many metrics, I think we have the best model out there now. And I
think that's going to drive increased adoption as well.
And again, I would reiterate, people are using – obviously, we have 1.5 billion users through AI Overviews
interacting with AI in a deep way, in a very engaged way. Obviously, we are innovating with AI Mode. And we
have a very exciting roadmap ahead with Gemini app as well. So across the board, super excited about what's
ahead.

Philipp Schindler A
Chief Business Officer & Senior Vice President, Google, Alphabet, Inc.
And on your brand question, brand and, by the way, also Direct Response had a very solid growth in Q1, brand
advertisers really enjoyed culture moments we had like Coachella, for example, or March Madness. We had
strong contributions overall from the finance and retail verticals in Q1 on the site as well.
The operating metrics for YouTube were strong in Q1. Watch time growth remains robust, particularly in key
monetization opportunity areas such as Shorts and Living Room. It's also, by the way, nice to see the strong
position of our creators who obviously benefit from the brand piece, which gives us a lot of confidence when we
look at it more closely. And on the Q2 side, I think I mentioned it's too early to really comment on that.

Mark Shmulik Q
Analyst, Bernstein Institutional Services LLC
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Sundar, I appreciate the color on Gemini deployment across kind of the 15
products with 0.5 billion users or more. It would be great to hear more about where you're seeing the most usage
and deployment of Gen AI internally at Google, perhaps whether the capabilities, are they in a place today in
terms of either supplementing or augmenting the workforce?
And then just to build on that earlier AI Mode type questions. Appreciate AI Mode has 2x longer queries than
traditional search. But any color you can share perhaps on how AI Mode behavior differs from how consumers are
using the Gemini app? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Look, internally, I mean this has been an extraordinary amount of focus and excitement both because I think we
are – the early use cases have been transformative in nature and I think this still feels like early days and long
ways to go. Obviously, I had mentioned a few months ago in terms of how we are using AI for coding. We're
continuing to make a lot of progress there in terms of people using coding suggestions. I think the last time I had
said the number was like 25% of code that's checked in. It involves people accepting AI suggested solutions. That
number is well over 30% now.
But more importantly, we have deployed more deeper flows and particularly with the newer models, I think we are
working on early agentic workflows and how we can get those coding experiences to be much deeper. We are
deploying it across all parts of the company. Our customer service teams are deeply leading the way there.
We've both dramatically enhanced our user experience as well as made it much more efficient to do so, and we
are actually bringing all our learnings and expertise in our solutions through cloud to our other customers. But
beyond that, all the way from the finance team preparing for this earnings call, to everything. It's deeply
embedded in everything we do. But I still see it as early days and there's going to be a lot more to do.
On AI Mode, look, I think we are just leaning in on the early positive feedback. Well, as we scaled up AI
Overviews, it's been one of our most positive launches. And – but it's been clear people have wanted even more
of it.
And so with AI Mode we are bringing the – our state-of-the-art Gemini models right into Search and I mentioned
people typing in longer queries. There's a lot more complex nuance questions, people are following through more.
People are appreciating the clean design, the fast response time and the fact that they can kind of be much more
open-ended, can undertake more complicated tasks, product comparisons, for example, has been a positive one,
exploring how-tos, planning a trip.
So those are the kinds of early feedback we are seeing. And I think we are obviously really focused on improving
the product across all of AI Mode, AI Overviews in the Gemini app. And we are seeing positive user traction as
well.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2025
Mark Mahaney Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thanks. One for Anat, and one for Sundar, Anat, getting back to a question I think that Doug was asking
earlier on, you just put up record high or multiyear record high margins for both Google Services and for Google
Cloud, you talked, Phil, about depreciation expenses accelerating rapidly throughout the year because of all the
investments you've already – you've warned people about.
Back in the September quarter, you seemed relatively confident that you had enough levers to kind of offset kind
of rising infrastructure costs. Was that still your – six months later is that still your view that you've got enough
levers that even with the rising infrastructure costs, you can – there's enough in there to kind of counterbalance
that?
And then just briefly on Waymo, that continues to rise aggressively, the numbers, Sundar. The long-term business
model for Waymo, is there a reason to make a decision on that soon? Or have you already made the decision of
whether this is a long-term licensing model or you really want to run this as a standalone ridesharing delivery
autonomous vehicle business? Thank you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anat Ashkenazi A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President-Google, Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks. On your first question on profitability and what levers do we have? And do we still have levers to pull.
First, I think every organization can always push a little further. I don't view productivity goals or efficiency as an
episodic kind of project-based effort, but rather a continuous effort that when you get to a certain place you push a
little further.
Having said that, we do have significant investments we're making across the organization, and we have been
making them for the past several quarters. And we've been able to do it, because we were able to find efficiency
to fund those investments across the organization.
Those are for products and services that are going to drive long-term growth for the company. So while we're
trying to offset as much of the headwind associated with the increase in infrastructure cost, it will become more
difficult. As I said, the depreciation will accelerate. We had about a 31% year-over-year growth in depreciation this
quarter.
And it will be higher as we go throughout the year. So think about that kind of as a headwind that we have to
manage against, but we're continuing with pushing across the organization, leveraging Sundar mentioned the use
of AI, and kind of an AI-first Google across several of our functions to help us manage a larger scope of work
using our AI, AI agents and AI tools.
As Sundar mentioned, we did leverage it in preparation for the earnings call and leveraging across several
functions. So there are opportunities, but there are also great opportunities for investment. And we want to make
sure that we make room for – to make these investments to drive long-term growth and ensure we have a very
resilient long-term growth profile for the company.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2025
And Mark, thanks. I think this is probably the first question I've got on an earnings call on Waymo. So thank you
and I think it's a sign of its progress. Look, the thing that excites me is I think we've been laser focused and will
continue to be on building the world's best driver.
And I think doing that well really gives you a variety of optionality in business models across geographies, et
cetera. It will also require a successful ecosystem of partners, and we can't possibly do it all ourselves. And so I'm
excited about the progress the teams have made through a variety of partnerships, obviously, a highlight of it is a
partnership with Uber.
We are very pleased with what we are already seeing in Austin in terms of rider satisfaction. We look forward to
offering the first paid rides in Atlanta via Uber later this year. But we are also building up a network of partners, for
example, for maintaining fleets of vehicles and doing all the operations related to that with the recently announced
partnership with Moove in Phoenix and Miami, obviously, partnerships with OEMs. There are future optionality
around personal ownership as well. So we are widely exploring but at the same time, clearly staying focused on
making progress both in terms of safety, the driver experience and progress on the business model and
operationally scaling it up.

Mark Mahaney Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thank you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Gawrelski from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth James Gawrelski Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo & Co.
Thank you. Two, if I may, please. First, on AI-powered search. You have a number of AI-powered search
interfaces, including three most prominently, AI Overviews, AI Mode and Gemini. In the future, should we think of
these as distinct experiences that will be long-lasting or more experimental now and Google will eventually focus
on one approach going forward?
And the second one is more on the financial side. You continue to experience very healthy gross margin
expansion. We see the TAC, sure, but you – now you also talked about the offsetting depreciation expense.
Could you talk about beyond those two buckets where you're seeing the real savings on the COGS line and
driving that gross margin expansion? And maybe even how we should be thinking about that going forward?
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
Ken, maybe on AI-powered search and how do we see our consumer experience. Look, I do think Search and
Gemini obviously will be two distinct efforts, right? I think there are obviously some areas of overlap, but they also
like expose very, very different use cases. And so, for example, in Gemini, we see people iteratively coding and
going much deeper on a coding workflow as an example. So I think both will be around.
Within Search, I would think of AI Overviews scaling up and working for our entire user base, but an AI Mode is
the tip of the tree for us pushing forward on an AI Forward experience.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2025
There will be things which we discover there, which will make sense in the context of AI Overviews. So I think will
flow through to our user base, but you almost want to think of what are the most advanced 1 million people using
Search for, the most advanced 10 million people and then how do 1.5 billion people use Search for. And we want
to innovate. And so I think this allows us to do that. But the true north through all of this is user feedback, user
satisfaction, user experience. And so that will determine where this all works out in the future.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anat Ashkenazi A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President-Google, Alphabet, Inc.
And to your question on gross margin, a couple of trends to highlight there. And I've mentioned this in the
prepared remarks, you've seen improvement in TAC that's really driven by the change in revenue mix with a
continued Search growth and the network revenue declines. Network revenue has a much higher TAC rate. So
that mix is helping us from a gross margin perspective. So think about that as well.
Now we do have depreciation for technical infrastructure hits in two – primarily in two places in the income
statement. One is in other cost of sales and the rest is in R&D. So it is in that line item that's impacting cost of
sales. Now we've had some efficiencies there, and I did mention the improvement in our overall cost of head
count growth and compensation, kind of moderating those growth.
So that helps us as well more than offset the depreciation increases in Q1, but as I mentioned, this number will be
higher in the coming quarters. Recall, we have – we said approximately $75 billion in CapEx, which is up from
$55 billion or just over $50 billion last year. So there is expected to be quite a significant increase in depreciation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Ron Josey from Citi. Your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Josey Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Philipp, I wanted to touch a little bit more on your comments around direct
response in YouTube. I think it's been improving and been a driver over the past couple of quarters. I'd love to
hear more just about what's driving that? Is that the demand gen and integration with PMax? Or are users
perhaps more involved on direct response now that Shorts usage is rising? Would love your thoughts there.
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philipp Schindler A
Chief Business Officer & Senior Vice President, Google, Alphabet, Inc.
Yeah. I think there is a lot of different factors. Mostly, we continue to help our customers really using our AI power
tools. You mentioned a few of them to drive performance. That's a very big one. As I mentioned before, we're also
happy with the progress we're seeing on Shorts and closing the monetization gap here to the overall business,
which is actually really nice to see, especially in the US. So we're very happy with that. Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sundar Pichai A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Alphabet, Inc.
And I'll just chime in to say, YouTube just celebrated its 20th birthday, and we now have more than 20 billion
videos on YouTube, and we get 20 million videos uploaded every day. So I think it's a tremendous platform and
thanks to all the creators and users who have supported us over the years.

Satya Nadella
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Jonathan. It was a very strong start to our fiscal year. Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $49 billion,
up 26% year-over-year. And our commercial RPO increased over 50% to nearly $400 billion, with a weighted
average duration of only two years. We are seeing increasing demand and diffusion of our AI platform and family
of Copilots, which is fueling our investments across both capital and talent.
When it comes to infrastructure, we are building a planet-scale cloud and AI factory, maximizing tokens per dollar
per watt, while supporting the sovereignty needs of customers and countries. We are innovating rapidly across
our family of Copilots spanning the high value domains of information work, coding, security, science, health, and
consumer.
And as you saw yesterday, we closed a new definitive agreement with OpenAI, marking the next chapter in what
is one of the most successful partnerships and investments our industry has ever seen. This is a great milestone
for both companies, and we continue to benefit mutually from each other's growth across multiple dimensions.
Already, we have roughly 10x-ed our investment; OpenAI has contracted an incremental $250 billion of Azure
services; our rev share, exclusive IP rights and API exclusivity for Azure continue until AGI or through 2030; and
we have extended the model and product IP rights through 2032. And we are also energized to innovate and
pursue AI advancements with both talent and compute investments that have real-world impact.
With that, let's turn to our momentum across our AI platform and Copilots as well as with agents. We have the
most expansive datacenter fleet for the AI era, and we are adding capacity at an unprecedented scale. We will
increase our total AI capacity by over 80% this year, and roughly double our total datacenter footprint over the
next two years, reflecting the demand signals we see.

Q1 2026 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2025
Just this quarter, we announced the world's most powerful AI datacenter, Fairwater in Wisconsin, which will go
online next year and scale to 2 gigawatts alone. And we have deployed the world's first large scale cluster of
NVIDIA GB300s. We are building a fungible fleet that's being continuously modernized and spans all stages of the
AI lifecycle, from pre-training to post-training, to synthetic data generation and inference, and it also goes beyond
GenAI workloads to recommendation engines, databases, and streaming.
We are optimizing this fleet across silicon, systems and software to maximize performance and efficiency. It's this
combination of fungibility and continuous optimization that allows us to deliver the best ROI and TCO for us and
our customers. For example, during the quarter, we increased the token throughput for GPT-4.1 and GPT-5, two
of the most widely used models, by over 30% per GPU.
We also have the most comprehensive digital sovereignty platform. Azure customers in 33 countries are now
developing their own cloud and AI capabilities within their borders to meet local data residency requirements. In
Germany, for example, OpenAI and SAP will rely on Azure to deliver new AI solutions to the public sector.
On top of this infrastructure, we are building Azure AI Foundry to help customers build their own AI apps and
agents. We have 80,000 customers, including 80% of the Fortune 500. We offer developers and enterprise
access to over 11,000 models, more than any other vendor, including as of this quarter OpenAI's GPT-5, as well
as xAI's Grok 4.
For example, Ralph Lauren used Foundry to build conversational shopping experience in its app, enabling
customers to describe what they are looking for and get personalized recommendations. And OpenEvidence used
Foundry to create its AI-powered clinical assistant, which surfaces relevant medical information to physicians and
helps streamline charting.
When it comes to our first party models, we are excited by the performance of our new MAI models for text, voice
and image generation, which debuted among the top in the industry leaderboards. And we continue to make great
progress with our Phi family of SLMs, which now have been downloaded over 60 million times, up 3x year-over-
year.
Beyond models, in Foundry, we are providing everything developers need to design, customize and manage AI
applications and agents at scale. Our new Microsoft Agent Framework helps developers orchestrate multi-agent
systems with compliance, observability, and deep integration out of the box. For example, KPMG used the
Framework to modernize the audit process, connecting agents to internal data with enterprise-grade governance
and observability. These kinds of real, production-scale AI deployments are driving Azure's overall growth and
once again, this quarter, Azure took share.
Now, let's turn to applications and agents we ourselves are building on this platform. We now have 900 million
monthly active users of our AI features across our products. And our first party family of Copilots now has
surpassed 150 million monthly active users across information work, coding, security, science, health, and
consumer.
When it comes to information work, we continue to innovate with Microsoft 365 Copilot. Copilot is becoming the UI
for the agentic AI experience. We have integrated chat and agentic workflows into everyday tools like Outlook,
Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Teams. Just nine months since release, tens of millions of users across Microsoft
365 customer base are already using Chat. Adoption is accelerating rapidly, growing 50% quarter-over-quarter,
and we continue to see usage intensity increase.

This quarter, we also introduced Agent Mode, which turns single prompts into expert-quality Word documents,
Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentation, and then iterate to deliver the final product, much like Agent Mode
in coding tools today. We are thrilled by the early response, including third-party benchmarks that rank it best-in-
class.
Beyond individual productivity, Copilot is multi-player. With Teams Mode announced this week, you can now
invite colleagues into your Copilot conversation. And our collaborative agents like Facilitator and Project Manager
prep meeting agendas, take notes, capture decision, kick off group tasks.
We are seeing a growing Copilot agent ecosystem, with top ISVs like Adobe, Asana, Jira, LexisNexis, SAP,
ServiceNow, Snowflake, and Workday all building their own agents that connect to Copilot. And customers are
also building agents for their mission-critical business processes and workflows using tools like Copilot Studio and
integrating them into Copilot.
The overall number of Agent users doubled quarter-over-quarter. And just yesterday, we announced App Builder,
a new Copilot agent that lets anyone create and deploy task-specific apps and agents in minutes, grounded in
Microsoft 365 context. All this innovation is driving our momentum. Customers continue to adopt Microsoft 365
Copilot at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite. All up, more than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use
Microsoft 365 Copilot.
Accenture, Bristol Myers Squibb, EY Global, and the UK's tax, payment and customs authority all purchased over
15,000 seats this quarter. Lloyds Banking Group has deployed 30,000 seats, saving each employee an average
of 46 minutes daily. And a large majority of our enterprise customers continue to come back to purchase more
seats.
Our partner PwC alone added 155,000 seats this quarter, and now has over 200,000 deployed across its global
operations. In just six months, PwC employees interacted with Microsoft 365 Copilot over 30 million times, and
they credit this agentic transformation with saving millions of hours in employee productivity.
When it comes to coding, GitHub Copilot is the most popular AI pair programmer, now with over 26 million users.
For example, tens of thousands of developers at AMD use GitHub Copilot, accepting hundreds of thousands of
lines of code suggestions each month and crediting it with saving months of development time. All up, GitHub is
now home to over 180 million developers, and the platform is growing at the fastest rate in its history, adding a
developer every second.
80% of new developers on GitHub start with Copilot within their first week. Overall, the rise of AI coding agents is
driving record usage, with over 500 million pull requests merged over the past year. And just yesterday at GitHub
Universe, we introduced Agent HQ. GitHub Copilot and Agent HQ is the organizing layer for all coding agents,
extending the GitHub primitives, like PRs, issues, actions to coding agents from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google,
Cognition, xAI, as well as OSS and in-house models.
GitHub now provides a single mission control to launch, manage, and review these agents, each operating from
its own branch with built-in controls, observability, and governance. We are building a similar system in security,
with over three dozen agents in Copilot integrated across Entra, Defender, Purview, and Intune. For example,
with our phishing triage agent in Defender, studies show that analysts can be up to 6.5 times more efficient in
detecting malicious mails.

In health, Dragon Copilot helps providers automate critical workflows. This quarter alone, we helped document
over 17 million patient encounters, up nearly 5x year-over-year. More than 650 healthcare organizations have
purchased our ambient listening tech to date, including University of Michigan Health, where over 1,000
physicians are actively using it.
Finally, when it comes to AI consumer experiences, we are excited about all the progress Copilot is making,
starting with Windows. Every Windows 11 PC now is an AI PC. Just two weeks ago, we introduced new ways to
speak naturally to your computer, including a Copilot wake word. With Vision, Copilot sees what you see on your
screen and you can have a real-time conversation about it. And with Action, it takes real action on your behalf,
interacting with both web and desktop apps.
In Edge, we are introducing first-of-its-kind AI features to automate multi-step workflows within the browser, and
help you pick up right where you left off. Edge now has taken share for 18 consecutive quarters.
In Bing, our overview pages now include embedded conversational capabilities. We took share again in search.
And daily users of our Copilot consumer app increased nearly 50% quarter-over-quarter. Among many updates
we made last week is Groups, which turns Copilot for the first time into a shared experience.
We are also creating a great consumer subscription offer with Microsoft 365 Premium. It brings together our
Office applications and advanced Copilot features with high usage limits, giving individuals the flexibility to bring
their own AI to work in a secure way. Finally, in gaming, Copilot provides a voice-first, immersive experience
across PC, mobile and our new Xbox Ally.
Beyond our family of Copilots and AI platform, we are seeing strong momentum across the portfolio. Cloud
migrations are accelerating. In data and analytics, Fabric revenue grew 60%, which is faster than any other data
and analytics platform in the industry. We now have 28,000 paid Fabric customers.
In databases, SQL DB Hyperscale revenue was up nearly 75%. 50% in Cosmos DB. In business applications,
Dynamics 365 gained share. In security, our end-to-end stack is now informed by 100 trillion daily signals. 1 billion
monthly active users of Entra. 16 billion Copilot interactions audited by Purview, up 72% quarter-over-quarter.
40,000 Sentinel customers. And we took share across all categories we serve in security. In LinkedIn, nearly 1.3
billion members. And finally, in gaming, we expanded our reach across every endpoint, focused on our higher
margin content and services. We launched critically acclaimed games like Keeper, Ninja Gaiden 4, and Outer
Worlds 2. Reaching 155 million monthly active users of Minecraft, an all-time high. And set new record for overall
content and services revenue for the quarter. We also saw a great response to Xbox Ally launch two weeks ago.
And set a new records for players on PC.
In closing, our planet-scale cloud and AI factory, together with Copilots across high value domains, is driving
broad diffusion and real-world impact. And we continue to increase our investments in AI across both capital and
talent to meet the massive opportunity ahead.
With that, let me turn it over to Amy to walk through our financial results and outlook. And I look forward to
rejoining after for questions.

Q1 2026 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2025
Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. First, as you heard from Satya, we were pleased to announce
the next phase of our partnership with OpenAI yesterday. They continue to choose Microsoft to power their
workloads, and together, we remain committed to driving innovation that meets real-world needs. Our Q1 results
were not impacted by the deal signed this week.
Now, on to the quarter. We delivered a strong start to our fiscal year, exceeding expectations across revenue,
operating income and earnings per share. We also saw continued share gains across many of our businesses,
demonstrating our leadership position in key markets.
This quarter, revenue was $77.7 billion, up 18% and 17% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased
18% and 16% in constant currency, while operating income increased 24% and 22% in constant currency. And
earnings per share was $4.13, an increase of 23% and 21% in constant currency, when adjusted for the impact of
our investments in OpenAI. FX impact was roughly in line with guidance.
Company gross margin percentage was 69%, down slightly year-over-year, driven by investments in AI, including
the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure and the growing usage of our AI product features. This was partially
offset by ongoing efficiency gains, particularly in Azure and M365 Commercial cloud.
Operating expenses increased 5% and 4% in constant currency, driven by investments in cloud and AI
engineering, including compute capacity and AI talent to support product development across the portfolio.
Operating margins increased year-over-year to 49% and were ahead of expectations with stronger than
anticipated results in high margin businesses this quarter.
When adjusted for the impact from our investments in OpenAI, other income and expense was $401 million as
interest income more than offset interest expense, which includes the interest payments related to datacenter
finance leases.
Capital expenditures were $34.9 billion, driven by growing demand for our cloud and AI offerings. This quarter,
roughly half of our spend was on short-lived assets, primarily GPUs and CPUs, to support increasing Azure
platform demand, growing first-party apps and AI solutions, accelerating R&D by our product teams, as well as
continued replacement for end-of-life server and networking equipment.
The remaining spend was for long-lived assets that will support monetization for the next 15 years and beyond,
including $11.1 billion of finance leases that are primarily for large datacenter sites. And cash paid for PP&E was
$19.4 billion. As a reminder, the difference between total CapEx and cash paid for PP&E is primarily due to
finance leases, as well as the normal timing of goods received but not yet paid.
Cash flow from operations was $45.1 billion, up 32%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially
offset by higher supplier payments. And free cash flow increased 33% to $25.7 billion, with minimal impact from a
sequential increase in CapEx, given the higher mix of finance leases. And finally, we returned $10.7 billion to
shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Now, to our commercial results. Commercial bookings increased 112% and 111% in constant currency and were
significantly ahead of expectations, driven by Azure commitments from OpenAI as well as continued growth in the
number of $100 million-plus contracts for both Azure and M365. These results do not include any impact from the
incremental $250 billion Azure commitments from OpenAI announced yesterday.

Q1 2026 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2025
Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $392 billion and was up 51% year-over-year. The
balance has nearly doubled over the past two years. And even with this growth, our weighted average duration
has been relatively stable at approximately 2 years.
Microsoft Cloud revenue was $49.1 billion, ahead of expectations, and grew 26% and 25% in constant currency.
Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was slightly better than expected at 68%, and down year-over-year due
to the investments in AI that were partially offset by ongoing efficiency gains as noted earlier.
Now to segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $33 billion and grew 17% and
14% in constant currency. M365 commercial cloud revenue increased 17% and 15% in constant currency, with 1
point of benefit from in-period revenue recognition. Year-over-year growth was driven by both ARPU and seats,
with ARPU growth again led by E5 and M365 Copilot.
Paid M365 commercial seats grew 6% year-over-year, with installed base expansion across all customer
segments, though primarily in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 commercial
products revenue increased 17% and 14% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, due to higher than
expected Office 2024 transactional purchasing. M365 consumer cloud revenue increased 26% and 25% in
constant currency, again driven by ARPU growth. M365 consumer subscriptions grew 7% to over 90 million.
LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, driven by Marketing Solutions. The Talent
Solutions business was impacted by continued weakness in the hiring market. Dynamics 365 revenue increased
18% and 16% in constant currency, with continued growth across all workloads.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 19% and 16% in constant currency. And gross margin percentage
increased, driven by efficiency gains in M365 Commercial cloud that were partially offset by investments in AI,
including the impact of growing usage in M365 Copilot Chat.
Operating expenses increased 6% and 5% in constant currency and operating income increased 24% and 20% in
constant currency. Operating margins increased 3 points year-over-year to 62%, driven by the higher gross
margin noted earlier as well as improved operating leverage.
Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $30.9 billion and grew 28% and 27% in constant currency. In
Azure and other cloud services, where we continue to see accelerating demand, revenue grew 40% and 39% in
constant currency. Results were ahead of expectations, driven by better than expected growth in our core
infrastructure business, primarily from our largest customers. Azure AI services revenue was generally in line with
expectations. And this quarter, demand again exceeded supply across workloads even as we brought more
capacity online.
In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency.
Results were ahead of expectations, driven by transactional purchasing of Windows Server 2025. Segment gross
margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency. And gross margin percentage decreased year-over-
year, driven by investments in AI that were partially offset by efficiency gains in Azure. Operating expenses
increased 4% and operating income grew 27%. Operating margins were 43%, down only slightly year-over-year,
as increased investments in AI were mostly offset by improved operating leverage.
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.8 billion and grew 4%. Windows OEM and Devices revenue
increased 6% year-over-year, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by strong demand ahead of Windows 10
end of support as well as a benefit from inventory levels that remained elevated. Search and news advertising

revenue ex-TAC increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, driven by growth in volume as well as a continued
benefit from third-party partnerships that was better than expected.
And in Gaming, revenue decreased 2% and 3% in constant currency. Against a strong prior year comparable,
Xbox content and services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency, driven by
better than expected performance from third-party content.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 11% and 10% in constant currency. And gross margin percentage
increased year-over-year, driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. Operating expenses increased
4% and 3% in constant currency, and operating income increased 18% and 16% in constant currency. Operating
margins increased 3 points year-over-year to 30%, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier.
Now, moving to our Q2 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. Based on
current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue growth by 2 points. Within the segments, we expect FX to
increase revenue growth by 2 points in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in
More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth by 1 point.
Starting with the total company, we expect revenue of $79.5 billion to $80.6 billion, or growth of 14% to 16%. We
expect COGS of $26.35 billion to $26.55 billion, or growth of 21% to 22%, and operating expense of $17.3 billion
to $17.4 billion or growth of 7% to 8%. Operating margins should be relatively flat year-over-year and down
sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality.
Now, other income and expense. The combination of OpenAI's conversion to a public benefit corp and the
ongoing nature of our partnership will result in increased volatility. Therefore, going forward, we'll provide our
outlook excluding any impact from our investments in OpenAI. On that basis, in Q2, other income and expense is
estimated to be roughly $100 million as interest income will more than offset interest expense. And we expect our
Q2 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.
Next, capital expenditures. With accelerating demand and a growing RPO balance, we're increasing our spend on
GPUs and CPUs. Therefore, total spend will increase sequentially, and we now expect the FY 2026 growth rate to
be higher than FY 2025. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure buildouts
and the timing of delivery of finance leases.
Next, our commercial business. In commercial bookings, we expect healthy growth in the core business on a low
expiry base when adjusted for the OpenAI contracts in the prior year. And we expect commercial bookings will be
positively impacted by the significant OpenAI commitments announced yesterday. As a reminder, larger long-term
Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings
growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 66%, down year-over-year, driven by the
continued investments in AI as well as the mix shift to Azure.
Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $33.3 billion to $33.6
billion, or growth of 13% to 14%. In M365 commercial cloud, we expect revenue growth to be between 13% and
14% in constant currency, with business trends that remain relatively stable quarter-over-quarter. ARPU growth
will again be driven by E5 and M365 Copilot.
M365 commercial products revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits. As a reminder, M365
commercial products includes components that can be variable due to the in-period revenue recognition
dynamics. M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid-20s driven by growth in ARPU.

Q1 2026 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2025
For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth
to be in the mid to high-teens, with continued growth across all workloads. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect
revenue of $32.25 billion to $32.55 billion, or growth of 26% to 27%.
In Azure, we expect Q2 revenue growth of approximately 37% in constant currency as demand remains
significantly ahead of the capacity we have available. And while we're accelerating the amount of capacity we're
bringing online, we will continue to balance Azure revenue growth with the growing needs across our first-party
apps and AI solutions, our own R&D efforts, and the end of life server replacements.
Therefore, we now expect to be capacity constrained through at least the end of our fiscal year. As a reminder,
there can be quarterly variability in the year-on-year growth rates depending on the timing of capacity delivery and
when it comes online, as well as from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In our on-
premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits with ongoing customer shift
to cloud offerings.
In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be in the $13.95 billion to $14.45 billion. Windows OEM and
Devices revenue should decline in the mid-single digits. We expect continued momentum from Windows 10 end
of support, although growth rates will be impacted by elevated inventory levels at the end of Q1 that we expect to
come down through the quarter. Therefore, Windows OEM revenue should decline in the low to mid-single digits.
The range of potential outcomes remains wider than normal. Devices revenue should decline year-over-year.
Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the low-double digits, down sequentially as
growth rates normalize following the benefit from third-party partnerships noted earlier. Growth will continue to be
driven by volume and revenue per search across Edge and Bing.
And in Xbox content and services, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits against a prior year
comparable that benefited from strong first-party performance, partially offset by growth in subscriptions. And
hardware revenue should decline year-over-year.
And in closing, demand signals across bookings, RPO, and product usage are accelerating faster than we
expected. We're investing in infrastructure, AI talent, and product innovation to capture that momentum and
expand our leadership position. And we remain focused on delivering real value to our customers that results in
durable revenue growth for the long term.
With that, let's go to Q&A, Jonathan.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
Please proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Keith Weiss Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question and congratulations on another outstanding quarter. And if I'm
looking at Microsoft, this is two quarters in a row, we're really seeing results that are well ahead of anybody's
expectations when we were thinking about this company a year ago or five years ago. 111% commercial
bookings growth was not on anybody's bingo card, if you will, yet the stock is underperforming the broader
market.
And the question I have is kind of getting at the zeitgeist that I think is weighing on the stock. And it – is something
about to change? And I think AGI is kind of a nomenclature or a shorthand for that. And it's something that's still
included in your guys' OpenAI agreement. So, Satya, when we think about AGI or we think about how application
and computing architectures are changing, is there anything that you see on the horizon, whether it's AGI or
something else, that could potentially change what appears to be a really strong positioning for Microsoft in the
marketplace today, where that strength will perhaps weaken on a go-forward basis? Is there anything that you're
worrying about in that evolution and particularly the evolution of these generative AI models?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Satya Nadella A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
No. Thank you, Keith, for the question. So, here's what I'd say, I think there are two parts. We feel very, very good
about even this, I'd say, the new agreement that we now have with OpenAI, because I think even it just creates
more certainty to all of the IP relationship we have as it relates to even this definition of AGI.
But beyond that, I think your question touches on something that's pretty important, which is how are these AI
systems going to truly be deployed in the real world and make a real difference and make a return for both the
customers who are deploying them and then obviously the providers of these systems. And I think the best way to
characterize the situation is that even as the intelligence capability increases, let's even say, exponentially, right,
model version over model version, the problem is it's always going to still be jagged, right? I think the term people
use is the jagged intelligence, even – or spiky intelligence, right?
So, you may even have a capability that's fantastic at a particular task, but it may not uniformly grow. So, what is
required is, in fact, these systems, whether it is GitHub Agent HQ or the M365 Copilot system. Don't think of this
as a product. Think of it as a system that in some sense smooths out those jagged edges, and really helps the
capability.
I mean just to give you a flavor for it, right? So, if I am in M365 Copilot, I can generate an Excel spreadsheet. The
good news is now an Excel spreadsheet does understand Office JS, it has the formulas in it. It feels like, wow, it is
a great spreadsheet created by a good model. The more interesting thing is I can go into Agent Mode in Excel
and iterate on that model. And yet, it will stay on rails. It won't go off rails, it will be able to do the iteration. Then, I
can even give it to the analyst agent, and then it will even make sense of it like a data analyst would of our Excel
model.

Q1 2026 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2025
The reason I say all of that is because that's the type of construction that will be needed, even when the model is
magical, all powerful. I think we will be in this jagged intelligence phase for a long time. So, one of the
fundamental things that these – whether it's GitHub, whether it's Security, whether it's M365, the three main
domains we're in, we feel very, very good about building these as organizing layers for agents to help customers.
And by the way, that's the same thing that we're going to put into Foundry for our third-party customers. So, that's
kind of how people will build these multi-agent systems.
So, I feel actually pretty good about both the progress in AI, I don't think AGI as defined at least by us in our
contract is ever going to be achieved anytime soon. But I do believe we can drive a lot of value for customers with
advances in AI models by building these systems. So, it's kind of the real question that needs to be well
understood and I feel very, very confident about our ability to make progress.

Brent Thill Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Amy, on the bookings blowout, I guess many are somewhat concerned about concentration risk. And I
think you noted a number of $100 million contracts, not to go into a lot of detail, but can you just give us a sense
of what you're seeing in that 51% RPO and 110-plus-percent bookings growth that gives you confidence about
what you're seeing in terms of the breadth and extent of some of these deals on a global basis? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Amy E. Hood A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Brent. A couple of things to maybe take a step back on RPO, with a nearly $400 billion balance, we've
been trying to help people understand sort of how to think about really the breadth of that. It covers numerous
products. It covers customers of all sizes. And that's been a balance that we've been growing obviously at a good
clip. But what people need to realize is it sits across multiple products because of the things Satya is talking about
around creating systems and where we're investing.
And if you're going to have that type of balance and then more importantly have the weighted average duration be
two years, it means that most of that is being consumed in relatively short order. People are not consuming, and I
say this broadly, unless there's value. And I think this is why we keep coming back to are we creating real-world
value in our AI platforms in our AI solutions and apps and systems.
And so I think the sort of the way to think about RPO is it's been building across a number of customers. We're
thrilled to have OpenAI be a piece of that. We're learning a ton and building leading systems because of it that are
being used at scale that benefits every other customer. And so it's why we've tried to give a little bit more color to
that RPO balance because I do understand that there have been a lot of concerns or questions about is it long
dated, is it coming over a long period of time. And hopefully, this is helpful for people to realize that these are

contracts being signed by customers who intend to use it in relatively short order. And at that type of scale, I think

Mark L. Moerdler Q
Analyst, Sanford C. Bernstein
Thank you very much for taking my question and congratulations on the quarter. It's pretty amazing what you
guys are doing. Satya and Amy, I'd like to ask you the number one question I receive, whether from investors or
at AI conferences I attend, how much confidence do you have that the software [indiscernible] (00:39:45)
business can monetize all the investments we're seeing globally or, frankly, are we in a bubble? In fact, Amy,
what would be the factors you'd be watching for to assure that you're not overbuilding for current demand and that
demand will sustain? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Amy E. Hood A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Maybe I'll start, Satya, and then you could add. Let me talk a little bit about maybe connecting a couple of the dots
because with $400 billion of RPO, that's sort of short-dated as we talked about, our needs to continue to build out
the infrastructure is very high. And that's for booked business today. That is not any new booked business we
started trying to accomplish on October 1, right?
And so the way to think about that, and you saw it this quarter in particular, and as we talked about 2026, the
remainder, number one, we're pivoting toward – increasingly, we talked about this short-lived assets, both GPUs
and CPUs, again, we talk about all these workloads are burning both in terms of app building.
Now, when that happens, short-lived assets generally are done to match sort of the duration of the contracts or
the duration of your expectation of those contracts. And so I sometimes think when people about risk, they're not
realizing that most of the lifetimes of these and the lifetimes of the contracts are very similar. And so when you
think about having revenue and the bookings and coming on the balance sheet, the depreciation of short-lived
assets, they're actually quite matched, Mark.

Mark L. Moerdler Q

Yeah.

Q1 2026 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2025
And as you know, we've spent the past few years not actually being short GPUs and CPUs per se, we were short
the space or the power is the language we used to put them in. So, we spent a lot of time building out that
infrastructure. Now, we're continuing to do that also using leases. Those are very long-lived assets, as we've
talked about, 15 to 20 years. And over that period of time, do I have confidence that we'll need to use all of that, it
is very high.
And so when I think about sort of balancing those things, seeing the pivot to GPU, CPU short-lived, seeing the
pivot in terms of how those are being utilized, we are, and I said this now, we've been short now for many
quarters. I thought we were going to catch up. We are not. Demand is increasing. It is not increasing in just one
place. It is increasing across many places. We're seeing usage increases in products. We are seeing new
products launch that are getting increasing usage, and increasing usage very quickly.
When people see real value, they actually commit real usage. And I sometimes think this is where this cycle
needs to be thought through completely is that when you see these kind of demand signals and we know we're
behind, we do need to spend. But we're spending with a different amount of confidence in usage patterns and in
bookings, and I feel very good about that.
I have said we are now likely to be short capacity to serve the most important things we need to do, which is
Azure, our first-party applications. We need to invest in product R&D and we're doing end-of-life replacements in
the fleet. So, we're going to spend to make sure that happens. It's about modernization. It's about high quality. It's
about service delivery, and it's about meeting demand. And so I feel good about doing that, and I feel good that
we've been able to do it so efficiently and with a growing book of business behind it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Satya Nadella A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Yeah. The only thing I would add to what Amy captured was, if you sort of look out, there are two things that
matter, I think, and that are critical in terms of how we think about our allocation of capital, also our R&D. One is,
how efficient is our planet-scale token factory, right? I mean that's at the end of the day what you have to do. And
in order to do that, you have to start with building out a very fungible fleet. It's not like we're building one
datacenter in one region in the world that's mega scale. We are building it out across the globe for inference, for
pre-training, for post-training, for [ph] RL (00:44:21), for datacenter, or what have you. So, therefore, that's – the
fungibility is super important.
The second thing that we're also doing is continually modernizing the fleet. It's not like we buy one version of, say,
NVIDIA and load up for all the gigawatts we have. Each year, you buy, you ride the Moore's Law, you
continuously modernize and depreciate it. And that means you also use software to grow efficiency. I talked
about, I think, 30% improvement on both serving up GPT-4.1 and GPT-5.0, right? That's software. That's sort of –
and by the way, it's helpful on A100s, it's helpful on GB200s, and it will be helpful on GB300s. That's the beauty of
having the efficiency of the fleet. So, keep improving utilization, keep improving the efficiency. So, that's what you
do in the token factory.
The other aspect, which Amy spoke to, is we have some of the best agent systems that matter in the high-value
domains, right? It's in information work. That's the Copilot system. Coding, I mean, I should also say one of the
things I like about Copilot is, I mean, Copilot ARPU is compared to M365 ARPUs, right? It's expansive. The same
thing that happened between server and cloud like we used to always say, well, is it zero-sum, it turned out that
the cloud was so much more expansive to the server market.

The same thing is happening in AI because, first, you could say, hey, our ARPUs are too low when it comes to
M365 or you could say we have the opportunity with AI to be much more expensive. Same thing with tools, right?
I mean, tooling – the tools business was not like a leading business, whereas coding business is going to be one
of the most expansive AI systems. And so we feel very good about being in that category.
Same thing with security, same thing with health. So, we have – and in consumer, one of the things is it's not just
about ads, it's ads plus subscriptions that also opens up opportunity for us. So, when I look at the entirety of these
high-value agent systems and when we look at the efficiency of and fungibility of our fleet, that's what gives us the
confidence to invest both the capital and the R&D talent to go after this opportunity.

Karl E. Keirstead Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you. This one is for Amy. Amy, I certainly don't want to take you down too complex an accounting
path with this question, but the investment in OpenAI that sits in other income at $4.1 billion is so large that I think
the audience could – listening in could benefit from a little bit more color about what that is. It feels like it's so
much larger than you were running through other income in prior quarters that it mustn't just be your share of the
OpenAI losses. So, could you just describe that and what we can expect in subsequent quarters and whether this
signals any kind of accounting change? Thanks so much.

Amy E. Hood A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Microsoft Corp.
The Q1 number was not impacted at all by the new agreement that was put in place, let me first say that.
Secondly, that increased loss was all due to our percentage of losses at OpenAI to the equity method. So, just to
be very clear. So, there is not anything there that is not the increased losses from OpenAI.

Operator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark R. Murphy Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you so much. So, we seem to be entering into a new era where the contractual commitments from a small
number of AI natives are just incredibly large, not only in absolute terms, but sometimes relative to the size of the
companies themselves. For instance, contracts worth hundreds of billions of dollars that are 20 times their current
revenue scale. Philosophically, how do you evaluate the ability of those companies to follow through on these
commitments, and how do you think about placing guardrails on customer concentration for any single entity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Satya Nadella A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Yeah. Maybe I'll start and then, Amy, you could add. I mean, it goes back a little bit, Mark, to what I said about
building first the asset itself such that it's most fungible, and then to recognize the strength of even sort of our
portfolio. We have a third-party business, we have a first-party business, we have third-party also spread between
enterprise, digital natives, I always felt that we need a balance there because it may start with digital natives.
They're always going to be the early adopters. You always have the hit app of the generation. And then
essentially then it spreads throughout. The enterprise adoption cycle is just starting. And so therefore, having the
– over the arc of time, I think that third-party balance of customers will only increase.
But it's great to have the hit first-party apps in the beginning because you can build scale that then if it's fungible,
and that's where the key is, you don't want to build for a digital native in – as if you're just doing hosting for them.
You want to build. That's where I think some of the decision-making of ours is probably getting better understood.
What do we say yes to, what do we say no to. I think there was a lot of confusion, hopefully by now, anyone who
switched on would figure this out. And so that's, I think, one thing we're doing on the third-party.
But the one first party is probably where a lot of our leverage comes, and it's not even about one hit app on our
first-party even. Our portfolio of stuff, which I just walked through in the earlier answer, gives us, again, the
confidence that between that mix, we will be able to use our fleet to the maximum. And remember, these assets,
especially the datacenters and so on, are long assets, right? There will be many refresh cycles for any one of
these when it comes to the gear. So, I feel that once you think about all those dimensions, the concentration risk
gets mitigated by being thoughtful about how you really ensure the build is for the broad customer base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Amy E. Hood A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Microsoft Corp.
And maybe just to help with another angle that I think Satya has helped a lot is that when you think about
concentration risk or delivering to any customer, you have to remember that because we're talking about this very
large flexible fleet that can be used for anyone and for any purpose, 1P, 3P, and including our Commercial Cloud,
by the way, which I should be quite clear on, it is pretty flexible in every regard, you have to remember that the
CPU and GPU and the storage gear doesn't come into play until the contracts start happening.
And so you're right, some of these large contracts have delivery dates over time. So, you get a lot of lead time in
being able to say, oh, what's the status? And so I think we're pretty thoughtful around what's always gone in our
RPO balance and been considerate of that. There's always been that taken into account when we publish that
bookings number and publish the RPO balance.

Brad Zelnick Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks so much for taking the question and I'll echo my congrats on an amazing start to the year. Amy, is
there any way to quantify or frame the revenue impact of Azure being short on capacity? And while I appreciate
the constraints you face are broad across the industry, is there risk of workloads going elsewhere and how do you
mitigate that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Amy E. Hood A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, Brad, it's a great question. It's always hard to quantify precisely what would have been the revenue impact
in quarter. But I would offer a way to think about it is Azure probably does bear most of the revenue impact,
because when you think about real priorities that you have to fill first, it's obviously the increasing usage and
adoption and sales we've seen of M365 Copilot and the usage of Copilot Chat, which we've seen very different
patterns, which we're encouraged by. It's the adoption of security features. It's the GitHub momentum.
And so when you're thinking about it, that is where and it is a priority for us to allocate resourcing there first. And
so you are right to ask how do I think about that? We've worked very hard to try to mitigate it as best we can, but
we have been short in Azure, and we've been clear on it.
I would say the other two priorities that I haven't mentioned maybe as much before it's also just making sure our
product teams and the AI talent that we've been able to hire into the company really over the past year and a half
have access also to significant capacity because we're seeing it make the product better in a loop that is adding
great benefit today into products people are using today for real-world work.
And so we are making that a priority to make sure our research teams have that as well as our product
engineering teams. And, yes, it does impact Azure directly. That is the place where you see that prioritization. But
I think it's probably hard for me to give an exact number, but it is safe to say that the number could be higher.

Operator: The last question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kash Rangan Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Thank you very much. Amy, I just wanted to congratulate you. I think you said before that it is possible to
accelerate Azure growth while getting efficient with margins and you have done it. Congrats on that.
I have one for you, Satya. With respect to the elephant in the room, following just – being a little more direct,
following up on Keith Weiss' question. There's talk that another hyperscaler came in and took away the business
that was rightfully Microsoft's. I'm sure that there is a different point of view here. I'm wondering if you could offer
some perspective on your criteria to – is it about a certain volume of business that you wish to execute on the
Microsoft paper or is it something broader than that that I don't think maybe people fully appreciate the terminal
value that Microsoft will have on its balance sheet at the end of these contracts, which I think is probably being
underestimated as you have a full stack and you've got the multiple vectors to monetize, be it databases,
Foundry.
And to your point that you are a platform company, not just hyperscaler, maybe that's what it is all about, or
maybe there's another story about you letting the other hyperscaler company coming from nowhere and claiming
a big piece of that four to five-year puzzle. Thank you so much once again, really appreciate it, and
congratulations.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Satya Nadella A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Well, thanks, Kash. I mean, for us, again, [ph] just all praise (00:56:25) goes back to, I think, the core principle,
which is build a fleet that is fungible across the planet and works for third-party and first-party and research. So,
that's essentially what we have done.
And so when some demand comes in shapes that don't fit that goal, where it's too concentrated, not just by
customer, by location, by type of skewing, right? I think Amy mentioned some very key things. When you think
about the margin profile of a hyperscaler, you've got to remember this, the AI Accelerator piece, but there's
compute, there's storage. And so if all of the demand just comes for just one needed that's really not a long-term
business we want to be in. That's even from a third party. We have to balance it with all of our first-party stuff
because that's after all a different margin stack for us. And then we have to fund our own R&D and model
capability because in the long run, that's what's going to differentiate us.
And so I look at all of those. We sort of use all of that to make sure we are saying yes to all the demand that we
want, we say no to some of the demand that may be something that we could serve, but it's not in our long-term
interest. And so that's sort of the decision-making we have done, and we feel very, very good about the decisions.
In some sense, I feel even each time we say no to, the day after, I feel better.

Operator: Please welcome. Head of Investor Relations at Snowflake, Jimmy Sexton.

Jimmy L. Sexton
Vice President, Finance, Snowflake, Inc.
Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for coming out to Summit this year. I hope all of you had a chance to see
Sridhar and Sam yesterday afternoon and the incredible platform keynote this morning with Christian. It's been a
really exciting last year for the company. You've seen us really hit our stride in terms of product innovation and
that has led to a number of new markets that we've entered and we hope today you walk away from this event
with a better understanding of kind of where we think we play and how we're well set up to go execute against this
next phase of growth. So, before I dive into the agenda, the safe harbor is here. We will be making forward-
looking statements today.
And so, now the agenda. So you have Sridhar, Christian and Mike all talking about this next phase of growth for
us and where we fit inside the data management lifecycle, our right to win within this new world and how AI
benefits us. I also think it's important for you to understand how to organize both from a go-to-market and a
product standpoint to help you better keep track of our progress and get comfortable with how we're speaking
about the business going forward.
And then lastly, we're going to have the three of them join us for Q&A, as well as Mike Scarpelli, who will be
dialing in. And so, when we do enter the Q&A section, I'll come back up. But we have mic runners, so please just
raise your hand and we will find you and then you can introduce yourself and ask your question.
So, with that, I'll hand it over to our CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Thank you, Jimmy. Hey, folks, it's really great to see many, many familiar faces here. And it's been even more
amazing to have gone through the past day at Summit. And you know, Sarah who was here, Sarah Guo who my
friend who interviewed Sam and I. Her feedback to me last night was, thank you for inviting us to your rock
concert. I was like, I thought I was running a data company. But it speaks to the interest and excitement that data
and AI have in the enterprise world. I mean, all of you know this, for much of humanity's history, data has been a
little bit of an afterthought. It's something that you used to report the news, that's why early writing was invented to
keep track of taxes or landownership.
I was very fortunate to be part of a company, Google, which thought about data fundamentally differently. There
are other examples like that. But in the world of search ads. Knowing how you did was essential to improving
what you did. I mean, think about it, the company itself. Google was founded on the premise that the best answer,
the best web page for a given query was one that the rest of the world said was the best answer for a given query
and how you break that feedback loop.
In search ads, we had a similar mentality. It's really the combination of the advertiser intent, combined with what it
users find to be the best answer that really drove how the team thought about what the product should do. And in
many ways, my data team there was just as large as the product team. Accidental, but it influenced everything

that we did. We built machine learning systems at PlanetScale 20 years, like 2005 before, like from now, a
decade before, they became widely popular elsewhere.
I think we are in a moment where the rest of the world, thanks to AI is waking up to the fact that data can
transform how businesses can and should operate. And it is that movement from data as an afterthought to data
is really important for you to get ongoing visibility and start predicting what you should be doing in the future in
your business as many of our customers like Disney have done, to do things like predict next best action, do now
thinking about wait, AI can take this one step further. It can drive business transformation in a fairly fundamental
way. Is what drives momentum for Snowflake. And I know, I speak for many of us at Snowflake that we feel very
lucky to have this opportunity. And as you saw it today, we're doing everything that we can to seize this
opportunity with all our hands. This is a little bit of a schematic, but it's a caricature of how we think about what we
call the end to end data lifecycle. When is data conceived typically in things like transactional systems, when you
open your app, that app sends a little message that says, aha, Sridhar opened this up. It gets recorded
somewhere. And so, we see our like technical mission as being there at all key aspects of this end to end data
lifecycle. When data is born, when it is ingested, transformed and cleaned, and then when analytics is done on it
and then the predictive analytics where the history is used to predict the future then gets done on it.
And what is also unique about this moment is this is the big unlock from unstructured data. You saw it on our
announcements today, whether it is OpenFlow, our Cortex Search that's because unstructured data has always
been a little bit of an afterthought in how people thought about data, it's just too unwieldy, you couldn't do that
much with it. You know, I joke to people where much of my life, Command F is my favorite PDF search engine. All
of you write very nice reports, but God help me. Until recently, if I had to figure it out what did you actually say
about Snowflake? Or a competitor? And – but it is that unlocking, where everything that we talk about, whether it's
data ingestion or cleaning or processing or analytic can now act on structured and unstructured data. And in a
world where metadata and governance is going to be even more important. You have heard the phrase AI ready
data, both in my keynote as well as Christian's keynote, it's not enough to have data, you need to have additional
information about what does it mean? And any of you that has done, written the SQL queries for a living or tried to
analyze data, knows that is super messy. I've spent thousands of hours analyzing data and we always give like
terrible names to all the columns, it's really hard to figure out what the metrics actually are.
It's just like, that's sort of how it works out. You have a column called revenue, you don't quite like it. You'll come
up with another column called rev 2 and the poor person that shows up two years later. Like, who are these
people and what did they do. And – but having that layer of intelligence about that data becomes very important.
And of course, finally, the world of consumption, this is roughly how we think about it. And when we talk about
wanting to play a critical role for our customers into the end to end data lifecycle. We talk about playing
meaningfully in these different layers. So the product strategy very much over the past year has been, how do we
release the key components that will let us play this meaningful role. Look, we understand that it is easy to say
things like all users, all data. That's an aspiration, that's not a plan. And part of what Christian and Benoit and I
and the rest of the team have been doing is be very methodical and deliberate about how do we attack this big
opportunity? What are the critical first steps that we should take and how do we always lead with strength? It's
easy to aspire to be something else, it's very hard to get there. If, a set of companies have gone at some area for
10-plus years, it is not all that easy for any other company to catch up. And so, I think it is really important that we
have the big vision, but that we are very deliberate in how we go about seizing that vision. And we'll get into some
detail later. But for example, in the space of databases and transactional stores, this is everything from recording
a session that you're having with a chat bot.
Two. How do you have a user store that remembers preferences that a user has? We have taken steps, we've
been working on something called Unistore for five-plus years now. That's meant to combine the best of a

transactional store with analytics, clearly has turned out to be a harder project than we thought. But it's out, it's
doing well. And the acquisition of the finally named Crunchy Data, it's an amazing company by the way and when
I first heard them, I was like, really? You call it Crunchy Data. But it's a really good company full of world-class
Postgres developers. It gives us an important component in how we go after this transactional market. And
another component is how do you make it much easier for people to ingest data into Snowflake, into cloud
storage? That's the Datavolo acquisition that happened six, seven months ago. We have brought it at record
speed to public preview, that's another thing that I want to stress, which is we are leaning much more into being
effective with acquisitions, getting them out mark-to-market, getting that feedback and getting that happy loop of
delivering customer value and iterating from it.
We think OpenFlow is going to make a meaningful dent in how people look at us, when it comes to getting more
data in from existing systems. Sometimes legacy systems and OpenFlow is also much more even between
unstructured and structured data. As I said, unstructured data is, I think is a massive unlock in many different
areas. And then we continued to invest very heavily in the bronze and the silver layers. These are the earlier
stages of data processing. Previously, in many of my conversations, Christian and I have talked to you about how
paradoxically Iceberg was the aha moment for us, a couple of years ago about what Snowflake could do.
In earlier stages of the data pipeline. We continue to invest very heavily in things like SnowPark. How do we make
sure that we are seen as best in class when it comes to early stage competition computation. And the partnership
with dbt, bringing dbt right into Snowflake. So it feels very much like a first-party product and the ongoing
collaboration with them. I think positions us really well in the earlier stages of the data lifecycle.
And we've always been best-in-class, in analytics. We intend to keep that lead. Again, finally, I've worked on
databases for a very long time and I've started working more with the team. And it's been fun both to see what
they have done and also to lean into what we can do in in the future. And then, as I said getting data AI ready is
going to be a key differentiator. We will have partnerships, but we also think that it is an area where we can drive
the ecosystem, in terms of having customers ask for their data to be data ready. Right now, we live in a world
where, yes, you can buy a catalog on the site, but that information is largely isolated from what BI tools do or if
you have some information stored in a particular report. I tell people that every meaningful report is actually an
encapsulation of meaning, because somebody has taken the trouble to go and say, hey, these are the different
pieces of data that need to sit in this report and it's meant for a particular persona, that's the semantic context of
the underlying data. A lot of our work around semantic views and making that commonplace is really based on
this belief that data and metadata need to be close to each other. And the closer they are to each other, the more
value our customers are going to get with it.
And we also think that this turns into things like data just being ready for agents, data both unstructured and
structured data being much more usable and composable. We lead in governance and you will continue to see us
invest and keep that lead. And then finally we see the world of consumption changing. And so, we are investing
into it, with the things that make sense, BI as a category, in our humble opinion, it's an established category and
we have great partners that we work with, us trying to do another BI tool doesn't make a lot of sense. But on the
other hand, you saw what Snowflake Intelligence could do today. And again, it's not that far to then be able to say,
well, I want to remember all of the questions that I asked today in my conversation and have it turn into a report
with these configurable parameters.
So, we see these as democratizing data access and redefining BI as a category. Remember, BI today works in a
pretty straight jacketed way, you have underlying data, you have some genius that knows about the semantics of
that data. They have to create the views and then they have to create the dashboard and if you as a business
user want something different, sometimes the BI tools, let you do it, most of the time you get to it. To us, the

flexibility of AI unlocks those things and lets us think about the category very differently, you're not the only ones
to be doing this, but we feel like we can do this with strength, we continue to invest in the notebook experience, in
things like machine learning, the predictive part of AI. And that is a product that we clearly came from behind, but
positioned as a natural add-on to what we do at Snowflake. It is gaining strength.
And we also see a world in which things like native application, native applications that are Snowflake specialty. It
is a way to encapsulate procedural logic close to data, it's not – it was never meant to be a full-fledged app
development platform. But what it does is it lets a partner like S&P Global take their data, attach logic to it, and
then ship it to a customer so they can use that logic. But now they're very excited about the fact that this can be
an agentic component that can respond in natural language, and it lets them create value at a whole different
level than what they have done before. And finally, it comes to sharing you saw Christian demonstrate today
already things like sharing now joined with AI and semantic models. Makes a lot of interesting things possible that
were not really possible before. Cortex Knowledge Extensions, super simple concept, it's a dataset plus a search
index, plus a model on top, this is a product that literally did not take much time to build because all of the
components are there, it gets turned into you have all of the data repository [ph] oft again (00:18:16) available as
one single component that you can embed into anything that you want to create, any agent that you want to
create.
So we feel very good about how we are setup and how we are executing on it. And I place a lot of emphasis with
ourselves, with the product teams on practicing what we preach about AI, AI has already gone through pretty
major transformations where the initial versions of foundation models were very good, if we could figure out how
to stitch things together and send it a particular bit of context and then they would give you a useful answer, it
went from there to these models are now very good at figuring out which data set that that they should be talking
to. And with things like Snowflake Intelligence we are not that far away from, they can begin to replace pieces of
workflows that are really important functions. And whether it is loan underwriting or like somewhat like what our
sales team does, for example, they should be able to automate pieces of it. So, we do a lot of practicing what we
preach. There's an internal tool called [ph] The Raven (00:19:28) which is an agent that is meant to surface
everything that matters to a sales person in one interface.
And we spend a lot of time thinking about how do we make our engineers more productive, our folks in sales
more productive. And a lot of that kind of reflecting has led to one thing that I forgot to mention at the very
beginning, which is we made a big push about roughly six, seven months ago to accelerate migrations, moving
data over from legacy systems to Snowflake, again using AI. You saw Christian's announcement about
SnowConvert. The idea is how can agentic loops make that very painful process of moving data from legacy
systems over to Snowflake? But that's a little bit, as I said, using AI ourselves, using AI in the product is a little bit
of a theme that we are constantly pushing ourselves and this is a world that's evolving rapidly. Cursor was barely
a company a year ago. But not only is the UX team that developed all those cool UIs using Cursor as their
primary IDE, they're being inspired by it and creating experiences like Cursor right within, right within Snowflake.
So, it's an incredibly rapid pace of evolution.
One question that you folks will ask yourself that we ask ourselves is. Gosh, this is a really broad surface. How do
we make sure that we actually get things done? And how are we organizing ourselves? And Christian alluded to it
in some of our slides. We have done a natural organizations both in the product and engineering team, but also in
Mike's go-to-market team, where we have pillars of teams organized – everything around analytics, including
things like AI-driven migrations. And we have another team that's focused entirely on data processing. Everything
that you heard around OpenFlow, the Spark implementations, dbt and so on is housed within that team. And then
we have a team that's focused on AI products. How should we be thinking about the future of business
intelligence or data science and then the final pillar is what are the foundational things that we need for people to

be writing applications and how do we make sure that we turbo charge things like sharing and semantic context
that can be attached to data and this lends itself to a very clean organization and part of the change that we have
made over the past year is driving accountability. There are leaders in the product organization that are singularly
focused on making these areas successful and they have partners in marketing, in Mike's sales team that know
when certain products are specialized and bring along the requisite expertise and Michael will talk about it a little
bit but as you folks know, this specialist motion is one that should be used carefully.
So, we understand the power of it, but we also think a lot about how do we distribute to the entirety of the sales
team in areas like analytics are very much that joint responsibility. And we have put in place mechanisms by
which the levels of our account executives, the sales engineers that's the dominant workforce in the sales team is
getting better with respect to the newer areas. With this larger lens, we feel that we are able to take on a much
larger market. This is obviously a thesis, is based on two things. One is the on-prem to cloud migration that all of
you folks are very knowledgeable about. But it is also our belief that a platform that centered on data and AI is
going to play a larger and large role in the world of cloud computing as we know it because we feel that data
centricity is really important in helping customers realize fast value. And the number of customers that I have met
even in this conference or barely a day and a half that have bet big on Snowflake and have had amazing results
sometimes in six months, sometimes in nine months to show for it is proof that we are well-equipped to take on
such a large TAM and realize a meaningful part of it.
You folks ask a lot of questions in all of our earnings calls about what's the thesis for, why we believe we are
going to be successful? And our consistent feedback to you has been that we derive our strength as a company
in continuing to be world-class at analytics. We'll get into a lot of detail about this. But we are at the very least,
many years ahead when it comes to the core technology. Others talk about serverless, we've literally been doing
serverless for a dozen years. And the same goes for what we announced today, which is the adaptive warehouse,
it represents a step change in how people should be thinking about analytic computation as a whole. And we
have a world-class team when it comes to how good we are with analytics. Lots of unsung stuff, including
obscure, but really hugely important things like pipeline execution for user defined functions. Most people don't
know, don't care, what that is. But if you're doing a Teradata migration, it turns out to be really, really critical. And
there are a dozen things like that. That has taken multiple dozens, sometimes [ph] of person years (00:25:47) to
get into the core engine. And we feel very confident about leading with strength in this area and things like being
able to drive migrations a whole lot faster. I've met customers who will roughly tell me, I have 50 on-prem data
warehouses sitting in this thing I really do not want to pay any money for. All you need to do is move the data
safely over to Snowflake. I can't have you miss any of that, that money is yours.
And so far we've been hamstrung in our ability to scale that quickly because those projects could only go so fast
because they were always human scale. Part of what excites us about AI is that ability to make that go a whole lot
faster. And by the way, that means we have to transform ourselves in terms of how do we think about running
migrations. We have a professional services team. And so, we are busy thinking about what is the future of that
kind of systems integration. And we'll talk about partners and those folks, the GSIs are having the very same
conversation.
When it comes to innovation. I think last year was definitive proof for us that when we put our mind to it, we can
really step up on the gas, we went from being, let's face it, a nobody when it comes to AI last year to every
customer wanting to know how they can use Cortex AI to not only get things done with AI, but to be able to
transform their business. And we do it in a position of strength. I've talked yesterday, Christian has talked about it
where we priced qualities like simplicity and tightly integrated products. You do something with Snowflake
Intelligence and create an agent. Everything that you put in with permissions, with data governance works out of

the box. And that is not something that people that essentially think of us of technology as just adding on services
is going to be able to easily catch up.
So, we have a long lead in many areas, but we also bring along a product philosophy that is going to strengthen
our position in the market. Mike will talk about this. But we actually think that while we have a healthy partner
ecosystem, we can be driving this so much more. I've personally involved in many conversations with many GSIs
and many partners. They can sense change in front of them. They can sense that system integration five years
from now is going to be nothing like what it was five years ago. And they're excited to be partnering with us
through this change, I think it's a point of real leverage for us.
We have an amazing team. Mike Gannon, who you will hear from, comes with a wealth of experience. In driving
sales teams at scale that I think will stand us in good stead. And Vivek became Head of Engineering some seven,
eight months ago. And the transformation that he has brought on the team, in terms of driving accountability
bottom to top, in terms of how we think about talent, how we think about getting products done, the sense of
urgency that he brings to the table. Like me, he's 24/7 all days of the year. I think that intensity shows through in
what we do.
And I'm also very pleased that Mike Blandina joined us. So Mike ran the payments group at JPMC. If I remember
correctly, some 8,000, 9,000 people processing a mere 10 trillion of transactions every day. This is a – it's an
amazing team. And before you ask a question about it, Mike continues to be super active. He is actually not here
physically because his daughter is graduating this week. But we have many promising candidates for CFO and
hope to be updating you folks relatively soon. And then finally, you see our event marketing. I am blown away by
the scale and just sheer quality of this event. And what often astounds me even more is Denise and her team do
20 more copies of those throughout the world. The energy in Sydney where I've been at or in Tokyo is like the
energy in this building. And I got to tell you again sort of super funny for the world of data to be this exciting.
I'll just spend a couple of minutes on sort of values, which I think are important. We've always been customer first.
I heard this from Frank. I think I told you folks this. I basically did a tour with Frank last year. Actually, it was the
year before last where we spent five solid days together. It was conversations during those that first brought up
the idea that perhaps I could succeed him. And part of what he drilled into me during the time that we spent was
how much people were betting. And they are betting on Snowflake. He is like, Sridhar people get fired if their
migration doesn't work. They're betting their careers on Snowflake. And that's why you need to take each and
every customer seriously. And when something doesn't go right, we need to swarm and make things right. And
you can sense that again in the conversations that we have with folks. We even more than before price
accountability. It has to come with the right structure but we have key leaders in the right positions that know what
success means for them and how that contributes to the team's overall success.
We have mechanisms. We use OKRs, at least at the top level, for driving down accountability and alignment but
these two go hand in hand. We structure ourselves, so that there is very clear alignment of how the parts add up
to something larger than the sum and we hold ourselves accountable and the quality that I've stressed with the
team, is ongoing excellence. My take is that excellence is a way of living, it's not a milestone that you get to and
that we are exceptionally lucky to be in the position that we are in. And it's really going to take us constantly
pushing ourselves to be better, to achieve the kind of company that we want Snowflake to be.
In terms of what this translates into, things that folks in this room care about. They're super disciplined. Our big
areas of investment are in R&D and sales, you will have a question about how many folks we added to the sales
and marketing teams, but we hold ourselves accountable. In every function, in R&D, for example, we realized at
some point that we were too top heavy and we are very intentionally focusing on people that are earlier in their

career because in a paradoxical way, they come less encumbered by like all the assembly language stuff that's
sitting in my head. For example, I did it 25 years ago, it's just not that relevant anymore. And so, we are very
thoughtful in how we invest in our R&D teams and in our sales teams and we hold ourselves accountable, not just
with folks like the account execs and the solution engineers for whom accountability is very direct and in-your-
face. But in every function, we spend a lot of time thinking about how do we make sure that these prized teams
that directly influence the future of Snowflake as a company are as productive as they can be.
I've talked previously about things like stock-based compensation. Some of it was driven by previous policies of
not being as frugal as we should be, but both in how we approach R&D and sales, where the majority of our SBC
goes, we have a very solid plan to have that be much more manageable. And the final point that I will make is that
we continue to be very active with M&A, but on our terms. I don't want to pay $1 billion or $2 billion for companies
making single-digit millions. Just like the math just doesn't work, we don't live in that world. But thanks to
acquisitions like Datavolo or even Neeva which was a very modest acquisition but laid the foundation for what we
did in AI and search. We feel more and more confident about our ability to acquire companies, to turn them into
meaningful businesses right from the get go. So, we are super active in this space. We are open to all kinds of
acquisitions, but they need to make sense and they need to create accretive value. All of this, the product
opportunity, the market opportunity, our shown ability to execute over the past year and more and the excellence
of the team that we are building up to, both at the leadership level but also in the rank and file at every level of
Snowflake combined with what we think are eternal values, cultural values and how we should operate with an
eye towards being sensible in business, make us feel really, really good about where we are as a company.
And with that, I am going to hand over to Christian to talk to you a little bit more about our product road map, what
we have done and what we are aspiring to do. Thank you.

Executive Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc.
Thank you, Sridhar, and hello, everyone. I seem to see many of familiar faces, many instances – we're joking with
someone that many of our interactions are on Zoom. So it's awesome to be able to see you face to face.
Let's get started. Maybe the most important takeaway from what I want to share today is a line what Sridhar
shared, which is we feel really, really good about where we stand, not only in the industry and relative to
competitors, but most importantly in the relationships and the impact that we're having with organizations across
industries of all sorts of sizes. The slide that I'm starting with, is a third-party study, it's a vendor. He was grilling
us and you know who the managed Spark vendor is and he was holding us accountable [ph] at heart like
(00:37:20) he was saying, okay, how do you do this? And we'll give an answer and he'll say this part of it is true,
but it doesn't work in this scenario. It's a very technical vendor that went deep, in public there's a blog post on this,
we can give you a source. This is the simplified version of that, but it highlighted something that we've been very
proud of since the early days of Snowflake. It speaks to what Sridhar said yesterday, just reiterated here what
Benoit said, which is we believe that we will win in the long run relative to the alternatives by leaning in on
simplicity and the ease of use for our customers.
And why is that such a compelling value prop? Complexity conspires against what customers are trying to
accomplish, right. We will talk about compute and I know there are some questions from you, but it is truly
dizzying to try to figure out what is the compute and since I need to do – used to achieve any one task, that's in
one cloud, not do it times three. We focus on that abstraction of complexity and simplifying things and that is how
we believe is the long-term differentiator and advantage for us.

Sridhar mentioned something that is super dear to all of us in the product and engineer organization which is, you
don't build an analytic system, a data processing engine. To the quality of what we have overnight. Yes, you can
get the synthetic benchmark to go and show results in such a short amount of time. But there's nothing like the
real-world. You say, okay, the simple test gets going once you try to do a migration from an actual system, then
you realize that it is hard. So sometimes even math doesn't add up, I've shared with some of you an instance that
happened maybe a year or so ago. We were migrating from Teradata. Results from the two systems were
different. Three months into big investigation, turned out that it was a bug in Teradata and this was core financials
of a company, but it took a while to go and validate those sorts of things. And this is the type of advantage that
Snowflake has, it's been battle tested, used by many of your organizations and thousands of customers around
the world. And we feel quite good about what our position currently is.
And of course, you saw this morning and we'll talk more about it. We're not standing still in any way, what the
study here [ph] and so (00:39:59) concluding is from a pure total cost of ownership, we come out ahead and I
think that where you start informs your choices. Like, I have no problem talking to customers about Databricks as
audience. They come from a thinker mentality, a very developer oriented mentality and removing knobs to make
things simpler, it's hard.
For us, it's easier to judiciously decide where we add more control because going the other direction is hard
because there's backward compatibility, there's unhappy developers, et cetera. It's not just total cost of
ownership, I think pure performance also matters, I said on the main stage this morning, I'll reiterate it, all
benchmarks need to be framed with the appropriate context. I think it will always be possible to find the one use
case where pick whatever system, shows it's better than another system that that I granted upfront. But what
we're showing here and we showed in the main stage is we took a set of representative benchmarks. We think
that they are correlated with what our customers doing in the platform. And what you see here are the results of
the Gen2 warehouse. I know some of you have questions on this. Gen2 is more updated, faster instances from
the cloud providers, but also a very comprehensive suite of optimizations that lead to this stable results compared
to both a Managed Spark implementation as well as a cloud native database.
But probably where the battle ground will truly evolve is in the open data. For the last couple of years, there was,
ooh, Snowflake is closed data. They're not truly committed to open file formats as open table formats and that's
where you're going to get killed. These are real numbers. Similar set of real customer workload-inspired numbers
for benchmarks on Iceberg data. We are leading in many, many types of operations, many, many type of use
cases and our conversation with customers. I was meeting with a large bank last night and it's like we want the
level playing field. What open file formats, what open data formats, what Iceberg does is it levels the playing field
and makes it easy for customers to switch back and forth between us and BigQuery and Microsoft and
Databricks. Yeah, that – that's what it does.
So truly, it removes the lock-in. And where is the value-based lock-in going to come from? Who's giving the best
experience and who's giving the best price performance? And we're ready to go and take on that battle all day
long. What I just told these executives of the bank last night was, we welcome that battle. We want to engage
because we believe that we're going to get an unfair share of that type of workload. This is what you see here.
Then I want to pre-empt some of the questions on compute. Super clear, we have always been and we continue
to be committed to be the leading platform in terms of price performance. There was a lot of questions on, do we
announce both Adaptive and Gen2 and why are you announcing two things that are similar but different and how
do we think about it?
So, I'm going to pre-empt some of your potential questions. In the same way that I said in the main stage, Sridhar
just reiterated, Serverless, which is the notion where customers don't need to think about computer instances,

was what we pioneered and what everyone else has followed up on or copied. We wanted to make sure that the
thought leadership that we're applying into Adaptive is out there because it's not just an idea. We have customers
that are running it. We are running on our internal instance of Snowflake. We call it Snowhouse. That's an
Adaptive, and the thing is phenomenal.
At the same time, tuning a system that is adaptive in nature, that is learning from behaviors is going to take some
time. So before, I don't know, a year from now we will have a conversation, well, but Adaptive is not GA yet. I
don't know exactly what's going to be the timeframe, but it's going to take some time. But we will continue
onboarding customers and delivering value for those customers. That is already – the train is in motion but what
happened with Gen2 was, again, there were new instances, which were materially more expensive than what
we've done in the past for as long Snowflake has been in markets, 10 years in June, very soon, 10 years since
General Availability of Snowflake. We've always transparently upgraded customers to newer instances.
We all collectively went through the journey of migration from older instances, C2 to C3. Then we did the R
migration and we always did is prices are stable, system gets faster and we have this conviction that if we
improve performance and improve the economics for our customers over time, that leads to longer term
commitment and additional work loads. The philosophy is still there, but what happened with Gen2 is the
instances were so much more expensive that if we did what we've always done, then it would not work, you would
all not be happy, we would not be happy.
So, what we did is, we had to introduce a new type of warehouse. It is priced at a higher level than what you see
in the traditional Gen1 warehouses. But it's so much faster that the price performance advantage for our
customers is still there. And that's why I have no problem in the main stage telling customers, go try it.
I got a bunch of emails today already, oh, we're trying this thing. It looks super fast. And yes, nominally it's more
expensive, but if you're spending less time, customers come out ahead. So, the notion is we had to do this just to
let out a ton of innovation levers, net new hardware instances. I don't know if at some point there's a Gen3 or
something in between. The future is adaptive, and adaptive is taking all of the benefits of the warehouses that we
know to this date. But you don't have to know if the size is small or large. Over time, it gets a unified with
Snowpark Container Services, which is sometimes that we gloss over details. There's warehouses, Snowpark
Warehouses, Snowpark Container Services, and we've done each one of those steps for a reason. But we want
to go back to our strength, which is if you have too many options, you're making it too hard. Go and remove
options and that is what Adaptive does. Hopefully, that helps clarify how we think about it.
And maybe something important for all of you. I think in many conversations I have with some of you in the room,
there's always been a question on, well, but why are you passing all the benefits of performance enhancements to
customers? Both Gen2 and Adaptive have now given us the ability to decouple performance enhancements from
revenue impact. And I'll say we are even if you go do the math and then look at the benchmarks on Gen2, we are
keeping some amount of the value. But I want us to also collectively understand that if we become a company
that is always keeping the dollars fixed and just, yeah, the performance is better, but the dollars are fixed, I can
tell you that, that's how we become the next Teradata. And we are very clear and very determined that's not going
to happen. But what this does enable us is to decide when and how much of those savings get passed to our
customers, which I think is something that all of you have given us feedback over the years and it's live on Gen2
and continues to be true on Adaptive.
Sridhar talked about product velocity. There is no two ways to go around it. Like if it's not evident by not only
Summit, and in Summit, we usually line up a lot of things, but Summit right now is a milestone. When we do build
in the fall, there's also tons of innovation and there has been so many other things that are happening in between

our large events that we're still doing launches. Cortex Agents, we did it like a month or two months ago. There's
other capabilities that we're just launching on a regular basis. And where does this come from? Sridhar already
alluded to it, which is we've organized products and engineering teams by what we call product category. The five
areas that you saw and I'll recap in a short little bit and each one of those has a clear swim lane and a clear
mandate and go as fast as you can and go and win in this category. It is also true that there is AI-driven
productivity. We had this fascinating story, like Sridhar mentioned, our PE team, our Product Experiences teams
and many others are using Cursor and other tools. But there was this funny thing that Benoit himself, he's still
coding and he is man plus machine these days. He is Benoit plus AI Cursor and he's been using it so much that
he got throttled last week. This is a true story. And he was up in arms. He's like, how do we give them more
dollars, so that my productivity goes back to what it was? And it was a fire drill. We gave them more money,
Benoit got the latest thing and he's back to being way more productive than he's ever been. That story is true, and
it's not just Benoit, but its engineers along the way. So, the ability to just go faster is becoming a key asset of how
we think about this.
AI thought leadership, Sridhar also mentioned, we've gone from zero to something in a very short amount of time.
What we have done is the original team that we had assembled that really no modeling and AI inference and true
AI research. They continue to build models. They were the ones that build Arctic and Arctic Embed. They
continue to build models for certain small areas where needed, like Document AI now has a new Arctic-extract
model and that's small, efficient, better than anything else out there.
So, we can do that. But we're also looking at where the state of AI can be improved. And we have an AI research
team blog. You can go on and look at the details on all of these. And they're producing world class results and
sharing with the community for us to go and be part of that AI leadership. The examples here are a little bit in the
weeds, but how do we make inference faster, which is what many of the slow chatbots go through it or it's too
expensive? Or we did some research on SQL Generation. The moment that we published it, we were number one
on the Spider SQL query benchmark. It's a standard benchmark everyone's playing. I was asking Katherine, hey,
can you confirm that we're still number one because the world of AI is moving so fast ? But yeah, as of this
morning, we're still not only number one, but we also are number two. So, we are far ahead on the spots of this.
And we'll continue to invest in AI core technology share with the world out there because we want to be part of
steering where AI is going.
Same is true of Iceberg. This one warms my heart in a very significant way because we are shaping where
Iceberg is going. We have hired a number of PMC members, the Program Management Committee folks, the
ones that vote on the proposals. We co-chaired the Iceberg Summit that happened here in San Francisco a few
months ago. And if anyone gets a recording of the presentation from Ryan Blue, who is the Chairman of the
Apache Iceberg Committee, he was very upfront. These two proposals came from Snowflake. These two
proposals got feedback from Snowflake. These are shaped by Snowflake. So and with you all as the audience, I
just enjoy it to know and be able to say we are steering Iceberg and we didn't pay the $2 billion that Databricks
paid. Like it's true. Like that is the reality. We're steering it and we're part of it and we're partnering with those
guys at Databricks. But we did. We were making good use of our shareholder money.
The roundup, this is the similar slide to what I had in the main stage this morning, the roundup on types of data is
very important. Analytical has been a story for a long time, of course, the beginning of Snowflake. Hybrid, the
Eight Step, Unistore. Yes, we underestimate it by a lot. Yes, I came and told you is the Holy Grail of database and
it still haunts me that it is the Holy Grail of database. But it's working, it's going better than we thought since it hit
GA, so GA took a long time. Someone stopped me in the hallway an hour ago and said, can we please get
Unistore on Azure, I have the use cases? So, I think that we have the capability and now we're rounding it up with
the Snowflake PostgreSQL, that comes from the Crunchy acquisition.

If I line up, the different enhancements from this morning. This goes now framed into the five categories that we
mentioned. Sridhar has already reinforced the importance of some of these enhancements. We think OpenFlow is
a major capability for us, just in being able to make more data available to Snowflake. Also, it gets us more
upstream into the data lifecycle. This is very important. If you think that data is being born in devices and IoT and
OLTP databases and somehow they land and then they go get process by spark and data breaks and then show
up in Snowflake for Analytics. This helps us be way more upstream in that lifecycle. So, we're early. We help
customers with data, as it's born. We help the customers with data when it's consumed, they might as well go do
the middle thing with Snowflake. So, there's a lot of strategic value in how we do this.
AI SQL, we spent time in the keynote this morning. We spent – there was a demo, but hopefully all of you got to
appreciate the piece, which is we're bringing AI to our core audience. The SQL-savvy persona, the analyst that
just now has this very strong toolset with multi-modality, with – it's not just text, but it's images and audio and we'll
do video, that's coming soon. Snowflake Intelligence, we talked about it. You saw it. I'm not going to spend time
here. And Sridhar also mentioned the AI ready data that matters a lot to us.
Last couple of slides. a year ago, I stood here in front of many of you. I gave you a taxonomy of the different
efforts we had. I said, well, we think that these are going to be material for FY 2025 and chatting with Jimmy and
Katherine is like, I'm not going to stand in front of you and not hold myself accountable to what we said. At least
the three that we said would be material for FY 2025. They largely turned out to be the case. We have started
looking at unstructured data as its own category because at the end of the day, unstructured data is generating
value for us through one of the two either Snowpark or Cortex AI, Cortex Search in particular. And if you look at
what we share with you in earnings and calls and callbacks, yeah, the first two Snowpark and Cortex are doing
well, but also Dynamic Tables played out quite strongly. And Iceberg, which was a conversation that we spent
maybe way too much time has materialized the way we originally would have wanted it, which is the tailwinds and
the opportunity of iceberg far exceed and outpace the potential headwinds of Iceberg.
Jimmy framed it at the beginning of this conversation. Of all the product enhancements that we are working on
and future innovations, we do want to think of them in this five product categories; Data Engineering, Analytics,
AI, Applications & Collaboration and Platform and you will see us talk in these terms and frame all of our efforts in
this same taxonomy.
At the end of the day, I'll end in the same state where I ended up this morning, which is the AI Data Cloud. I want
to invite Mike Gannon onto the stage. Thank you. Great to see you all.

Michael Gannon
Chief Revenue Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Good afternoon and welcome. Hopefully you're feeling the energy in the conference this week. I'm curious
because this is my first summit, show a hands first summit for everyone else in the room. Okay. About 30%. Well,
by way of introduction, Mike Gannon, 80 days on the job as Chief Revenue Officer for Snowflake and feel
absolutely thrilled to be here. The energy and excitement that I'm getting from this conference is revitalizing, why
this decision? And this is only the third career decision I've made in my life, is probably one of the most exciting
chapters of my career. But I want to share with you a little bit of background.
First chapter of my career started in 1997. I drove from S.U.N.Y. Oswego, New York to Hopkinton,
Massachusetts, for an interview with this company called EMC Corporation. It was probably the more unpopular
route to take. Most of my friends had gone into finance and insurance. I went a different route and took a run at a
technology company and had the good fortune of landing a job there as an inside sales associate. Number one

job was setting up 15 qualified sales calls a week, and in 1997, EMC was not quite a household name. We were
trying to get customers to decouple a storage decision from buying a compute, which traditionally was a
peripheral, but learned a lot during that time.
One was, first and foremost, we had to define a market. EMC was really defining an element of what was
considered the enterprise storage market, and over time we had great success. I certainly learned the role
humility plays in being hung up on 50 times a day, but continuing to pick up the phone with a smile and getting the
next person on the phone. And eventually, we started hitting stride. But the tectonic shifts that really occurred in
the market that really brought – prominent a role for enterprise storage was the Internet, right. And it really started
taking shape there. And one of the lessons I bring to the discussion today that we're having with customers is,
let's make sure we've got a monetization plan in place before we go invest millions and millions of dollars into a
data architecture, because you can tell, I don't know if you remember the dot-com boom, there was people
spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a business model that never had a revenue generating outcome. So,
you bring those learning lessons through time to have conversations with customers.
But the other thing I learned during that time and again, this is the first chapter of what was the first 15 years of
my career, was maintaining relevance with customers. And at the time, we had a single product family, we had
some software that helped customers with replication from a disaster recovery perspective, but we weren't
capturing the low-ended mid-market and we made an acquisition with Data General.
So again, our relevance was important because customers have to have buy criteria for not only the high end of
the market but the low end of the market. Relevance had to expand beyond that, right? We made an acquisition.
That's where we first met Frank and Data Domain because customers wanted a different way in a more
transformational way of doing backup and recovery, right. And then we bought this little company called VMware,
which is an interesting one, head scratching back then. But today, boy, what an acquisition that was.
So, one of my learning lessons coming out of that first chapter of my career was really what it took to define a
market, but then what it took to maintain relevance as a leader in that sector. And at the time, Pat Gelsinger was
the president of the company. He had been moved over to run VMware. I started to get an appreciation for how
software was eating the world.
So, I took a run. I had the good fortune of being mentored by Bill Teuber, our vice Chairman. At the time, I said,
hey, I'd really like to go take a run at getting some software experience. And he got me the right introductions. I
landed a role in strategy and operations, and at the time, VMware was still an incredibly successful product
company. But they were also faced with staying relevant. All right.
So, my first task at VMware was to build a specialist sales force that was going to help define what was a
software defined data center. Ultimately, the elements of a virtual cloud, right. If you look at any of the
hyperscalers today, right, there's some pretty common architectural decisions, which is x86 is the atomic unit
which all software functions run on top of. And we virtualized them, we abstracted both compute storage and
networking. And that was my job at VMware is to build a specialized sales force that can go and help customers
build out a private cloud function that was as real and as priced and as performant as what they would get in the
public cloud. And public cloud was obviously just starting to take shape. I mean, customers started to figure out
what was the role that public cloud was going to play, because they've got all these assets obviously running and
fueling their existing business models, but they saw this great opportunity from a time to market perspective,
where they could swipe a credit card and have a developer up and running in the cloud.

So during that time, again, it was a learning lesson of defining a market, staying relevant, right, and making sure
that we gave our customers the greatest hybrid cloud experience. And after 11 years and we had just finished
taking the organization through a big integration, through an acquisition, I started to recognize that data was
starting to take over the world. And that to me was when I started to really start looking at the landscape of what
was the next chapter of my career going to be. And I typically don't move around often. If you look at the LinkedIn,
you'll see it's really been three, three jobs in three decades.
So, I started to look at the market. I had some conversations with some senior executives that I maintained close
contact with, and it became really apparent that Snowflake was an exciting company. There was an exciting
tectonic shift happening with AI that was going to obviously put a huge dependency on having a good [ph]
dividends (01:02:53), data governance and data foundation that was going to fuel the next generation of
companies. Very much like if you think back in 1997, no one would have thought of a business concept like
DoorDash and Uber, right? But that foundational technology [ph] afforded (01:03:05) new business models to
emerge and that's the same opportunity we have today of sitting with customers and talking about how we can
unlock the value of the data they have, the assets they have to open up and exploit new business opportunities,
monetization and commercialization of data.
So, that to me is one of the most exciting conversations I continue to have with customers because it's very easy
as I come into this role 80 days and to try and wrap my brain around all the concepts and the data and the
products. It could just be an overwhelming amount of information. Our customers are feeling this as well. There's
a lot of noise in the market, there's a lot of competing strategies. So, my first role is really just asking the
foundational questions when I've met with 35 customers and 30 partners, why? Why'd you make this decision?
And depending on what organs, what industry vertical you're talking to, for the most part and as you've seen time
and time again, it's easy, it's connected, it's trusted. But I had an opportunity to sit with a customer about a month
ago, and I asked why this – why the decision was made to go with Snowflake. I'm still in that kind of learning
mode, asking the five year old questions, why, why, why? And this is when it really dawned on me the impact
we're having. So, we had one of the largest contracting suppliers in the country, basically walk me through what a
bid process look like.
So, a blueprint gets submitted into a portal, a bid analyst takes downloads the blueprint, and they start looking at
putting a bill of materials together for the amount of lumber, the trusses, the doors, the windows, the thresholds,
everything that goes into spec-ing out and building that house. They submit their bid. They get a 20% hit rate.
Okay. So, where's the opportunity here ? How can AI, how could we unlock more value for this customer? Well,
we had industry vertical specialists sitting next to this customer and basically start prototyping what the value and
opportunity could be.
So, we took that unstructured data source, which was not in the platform, brought it into the platform, married it up
with the contextual data of basically what they already had in their structured dataset and basically started
prototyping an AI model that would go in front of that bid manager. And we can get through 100 quotes in one
day, which typically would take three days for a human to scrape through that architectural plan and put a bid in
place.
So, is the power of unlocking, right, the opportunity to say basically, let's look at making sure all of your datasets
come into this to make an informed decision, but increased productivity. Then we take it a step further and we
say, okay, once you win that bid, now let's have a next discussion around supply chain. Now, you want to set then
expectation with your customer on how long is it going to take for these suppliers to arrive on site? Because
ultimately a builder wants to get this house built as quickly as possible so we can sell it. And we start introducing,
partners like Blue Yonder into the conversation who are going to help customers with that supply chain

component. So now, all of a sudden, we've unlocked a business outcome that had never been conceived before.
And that to me, is one of the most exciting elements we have in front of our market today, is to help customers
think differently about how they unlock value from their data.
And again, these are business discussions. This is a discussion I can easily have with a customer, but obviously it
takes a different way of thinking about their business models. And I think it's most certainly true now and you've
heard this before, it will be the fast that eat the slow. It is most definitely not the big that eat the small. And we're
excited by helping customers unlock that value and giving them velocity in their business plans.
So, easy. You've probably heard this multiple times today. We can get a Snowflake instance up and running with
incredible ease. It doesn't take an army of engineers to get this instance up and running. We can help you get
your data into the platform very quickly. Structured, unstructured, we marry it, we'll analyze it, we'll warehouse it,
we'll build AI prototyping models and machine learning prototyping models against it, and we'll start unlocking
value.
Connected, so we have instances where one of the largest investment banks down on Wall Street had a
conversation about how they get their data from market feeds, and it became obvious to me when they said, hey,
we basically have this connection with Moody's and Standard and Poor's where we can get instantaneous access
to data to start running our models against. But we've got one of the rating agencies that still continues to send us
FTP data 7 hours every night. It's just, that's where the slow is going to obviously have a disadvantage.
So, you start thinking about the connective tissue of connecting a buy side and a sell side customer together say,
hey, how could we share data to accelerate the business value, so we can be more informed? So, we start to see
this kind of network effect happen, and that's one of the most exciting things I'm also starting to unlock is the
value of that snowflake network that we can provide to customers.
And trusted, critically the most important element of our value prop is the governance, the security, the data
protection, everything that we put into making sure that the data, once it's in the snowflake platform, is a vault,
right. That is the, I'd say, largest apprehension most executives have when they think about AI is security. It's data
privacy, it's governance. We spend a lot, a lot, a lot of engineering time making sure this is the most trusted
platform in the market. But this is the theme that we get from customers. When I ask those questions on why
they're making a Snowflake decision, the most common patterns we see is it's easy. It's connected, it's trusted.
So, I have the good fortune of running the go-to-market organization. It's not just sales that is not the only people
in the organization. Obviously, that we – I'll show you the organization in a bit. We spend a lot of time with the
sales organization. One of the things that, I look at when I was interviewing for the job and I talked about with
Sridhar and some of the board members about what I believe Snowflake needed to get to the next chapter of
growth, it was scale and velocity. Scale in the sense of, we could double and triple the sales force, of course, to
drive more revenue streams. But we've got to act smarter about how we scale an organization, which is why I'm
going to talk a little bit about our partner community and our alliances in a little bit, but velocity is where we're
starting to eat some of our own dog food.
You saw today, there's some announcements around Snowflake Intelligence. It was referred to earlier as Raven. I
hired over 500 sales and marketing folks in Q1. Getting them as productive as possible as quickly as possible is
truly important in a hyperscale market that we're operating in today, but typically would take a year to get a rep
fully productive I need in six months. How do I onboard a rep and put them in front of a platform such as
Snowflake Intelligence and allow them to run an instant, large language query about a customer that they're going
to go visit.

And I'll use Caterpillar as an example. I've got a new rep on Caterpillar, and he goes into Intelligence, and he
says, hey, tell me about the profile of my customer. It'll go and dip into our database and say, Here's the
consumption they have on your platform, compute and storage, right. Here's the use cases we're using with this
customer. Here are the use cases that have been identified in pipeline, right, because we're looking at Salesforce
data. You've got a couple of open ticket, support tickets you need to be aware of. All right. And it starts to build a
complete picture of what's going on with that customer. But now, an exciting opportunity exists where you
incorporate a technology like Canva into the equation and say, build me a curated executive summary. So, when I
show up to that customer, I can show them a good profile of what we do in the business outcomes that we're
delivering, as well as what we're doing with some other companies in the manufacturing sector. That's a
productivity boost. We can never have done before if we weren't eating our own dogfood. So, I'm excited by what
we're deploying. My goal is to make sure our sales force is the most productive people that are leveraging AI and
machine learning to make sure that they show up and they ramp up quickly.
Our partner community is critically important to scale. I talked about scale and velocity, two of the most important
elements of, I believe, my job. We get good scale from partners. We have our hyperscaler partners that are
clearly the Amazon and Microsoft, Google, great partnerships with each of those organizations. We get some
scale there.
Our global systems integrators are giving us some scale. We've got three of the five that have committed to, in
practice, $1 billion organization to basically build a practice around Snowflake because customers are drowning in
data. They're looking to unlock value. They're trying to deliver business outcomes, but they can't glean enough
intelligence about the data.
So, I'm excited to see the kind of lift we're getting from our global systems integrators. We've also got a number of
customers that have built a business on top of Snowflake that gives us great scale. So, companies like Fidelity
that started as a great customer have unlocked and monetized their data and using that as an opportunity to drive
a new revenue stream. So, helping a technology office now become a revenue stream through data and with
Snowflake is an incredibly exciting opportunity. So, I've built a organization that basically supports these, what we
call data cloud providers, and we've got hundreds of these data cloud providers.
But the one area of the business I am looking to unlock and activate is a true distribution network. Where I get
what was those true, value-added resellers. These are connections I had made over the years with, say, on
VMware, I learned how you scale an organization through the channel. That is one of the areas I'm spending a lot
of time is focusing on how I activate a distribution network through value-added resellers. It's something we really
frankly haven't done a good job at, but I know that, that will be the future on how we scale this organization.
And around specialization, I have had a lot of experience not only building specialist organizations, but also
understanding when you sunset a specialist organization. If I go back to my time at EMC, we had brought in Data
General and we had midrange storage specialists that were going in front of customers and talking about the
differentiation of that particular technology. At some point in time, that became a core element to what our core
sellers did. We didn't need that specialization anymore. Instead, right, we had just acquired Data Domain. We
want to invest in specialization around backup and recovery. So, at times one of my roles here is going to make
sure that we've got the right volume of specialization supporting the business.
So, I'm spending a lot of time right now on investing in both technology specialization, so we can help customers
unlock and build prototypes around AI and ML because they need help, understanding the value and the vision
around what we can do, but also our industry specialization. Having someone who's been in the corporate capital

Investor Day 03-Jun-2025
markets, who has been through a manufacturing supply chain discussion, bringing those business minded
specialists into a conversation, so that we can unlock the value and vision of what we can do for them with data is
hugely important.
So, I'm getting really excited about we have an existing team, but putting a little bit more wood behind the arrow to
make sure that specialization isn't just product. All right. It's also the industry and the outcomes, right. As I've told
my sales teams many times, right, good people sell product. Great people sell outcomes. So, we're intent on
making sure we're delivering outcomes.
I've been confronted with a lot of complex issues throughout my career, and I was taught this very early. There's a
really very simple decision support matrix I will go through. So, whenever someone comes to me with an alliance
question, a partner question, a compensation question, you name it, it's pretty simple. What's the right thing to do
by the customer? What's the right thing to do by Snowflake? What's the right thing to do by the individual
contributor? It's very simple. 99.999% of the time, you're going to get the right outcome.
So, I bring to this role a very customer obsessed focus. All right. Everything that we do is built around making sure
our customers are successful. Are we bringing in the right level of resources to deliver the right outcome, so that
we earn our seat at the table for the next workload? In a subscription model, unlike anything I've sold before,
hardware product sits on the floor for five years, software perpetual license contracted for three to five years.
They own it in perpetuity and then you're just selling maintenance and possibly upselling them more capacity in a
subscription world that we live in. You're only as good as your last use case. We have to show up every single
day making sure the customer's getting value of this platform. That's where we're spending a lot of our time.
Sridhar talked a little bit about this earlier as well, accountability. Everyone in my organization and by the way,
when I got here, there was only half the team that was on a variable compensation plan. Compensation always
drives behavior. The behavior we are driving is a customer obsessed mindset. We're moving the entire
organization with the exception of customer support to a variable comp plan because accountability has to be in
their compensation and we have key metrics that are in place to make sure that the sales in the SE world is quite
frankly, very simple. It's a very binary outcome, right? Are you driving bookings or are you driving consumption?
But our partner community, our alliance community, they all have to have metrics. Our inside sales teams need to
have metrics. We're looking at productivity on a weekly basis to make sure we're getting yield out of those assets,
because when I go to Sridhar in a couple of months and ask for potentially another couple of 100 to 1,000 heads,
I need to have a strong ROI statement against that.
So, I'm bringing in a very strong operational and disciplined mindset to the business. Every person we bring into
this company has to have a strong ROI, and we can't have people sitting around being complacent in their role.
This market is moving way too fast for us to be complacent in any way. So, I'm spending a lot of time right now
talking to teams about accountability. We're putting strong metrics in place. We're looking at this on a weekly
basis so that people know how they're being measured. It's the most important thing you can do is making sure
people know what to expect and how they're being measured. Absent of that, you get complacency.
So, we talked about the organization. We made a decision about a couple of months ago to bring the customer
support organization into go-to-market. To me, this was critically important, not just to make sure the customer
feels smothered with support, which is truly important as subscription business, as I stated a little bit earlier. We
got to make sure that there's a strong alignment with our customer support engineer so that after that use case
goes live or after we onboard a new customer, they immediately know who to call if something goes wrong
because something's going to go wrong as technology, we know that it breaks.

So, we got to make sure that, that team is completely integrated and ingrained in the customer fabric and the
customer experience. So, we made a purposeful decision to do that. It's also critically important that those support
engineers give Christian and Vivek the feedback loop on what we want this product to do, right. So, that is an
important element to making sure we stay relevant, is that we're continuing to deliver value to customers and
we're giving them the innovation they need.
We've got a large organization built around marketing, everything that you're seeing here this week, which is to
me an inspiring collection of partners and customers coming together. I'm overwhelmed to see 20,000 people
here. In my last role, I think at the peak at VMware, we had about 18,000. And this is our sixth summit and we're
already at 20,000. It just tells you how exciting of a marketplace we are in but the draw we're getting for
customers, they're trying to figure out how they can put a strong data platform together and also leverage AI to
unlock that business value.
We've got a strong Professional Services organization that helps gets customers up and running once a contract
get signed. I'm being very clear with Ted, who runs this organization, we are absolutely not competing with our
channel, right. Professional Services job is to help customers drive consumption. If you've got a competent
partner that's involved there, my first preference, let the partner drive the consumption. There's going to be certain
instances where it has to be my organization that does it in a highly regulated environment. Maybe on the first use
case, we've got to prove it out. We're going to go in and do it. But my job and what I'd say Ted's job is to make
sure our channel is completely enabled and competent, make sure that they're certified, they're competent. They
know how to get this up and running. And by the way, we've got hundreds of Professional Services. We call them
True Blues out there, driving the platform and the consumption. But to me, my first preference is get those
partners activated, get them enabled. This is not a profit center for us. Right. In my previous lives, professional
services was a profit center. That is not the job of this organization. The sole purpose of this organization is to
drive consumption.
We've got a strong partner community. This is an area I'm going to continue to invest in, is making sure our
partners feel like first party citizens, if you will, as important as my customers and I have to treat them that way.
And then we have sales development, which is really a part of the initial interaction of we get 450,000 impressions
a week. That leads to 13,000 interactions, phone calls, which leads to 4,000 in-person meetings, which inevitably
leads to a new logo.
So, we've got a good supply chain. We're looking at areas in which we can leverage AI to increase those hit rates
in terms of 450,000 impressions leading to 13,000 meetings. I want to get that number up because that's going to
lead to new logos. So, we're doing a great job leveraging our technology to increase that count and that
productivity.
So, one of the things, as I've come to learn is it's truly important you've got a balanced business. Balanced in the
sense that we're driving net new bookings through new customer acquisition and balanced in the sense that we
also have continued strong consumption. We actually have got to a place where we feel really good about our
operating model. We've got certain skill sets and I'll call them muscle mechanics built around how to acquire a
new customer. It takes a certain mindset of an individual and a certain amount of resources and talent to get that
new customer acquired and onboarded.
And then as we get through that transformation and we start looking for how we're going to continue to maintain
relevance, it's truly important we surround the customer with even more resources to drive expansion. So, we've
got a good model set up where we've got people that are just focused on purely driving acquisition as well as
purely driving expansion. And we've got a specialist organization that again goes through not only product

specialization because we still are always going to have to compete for the next workload and we can differentiate
our value proposition from a technology and product perspective. But then bringing the industry organization
people to sit with a customer and talk about in a manufacturing use case, Hey, have you guys considered, right, a
supply chain outcome? Or if we're sitting with a financial institution, hey, here's what we're doing with another
bank to look for fraud detection, right? Or anti-money launder – or money laundering, right? Those are real use
cases and real outcomes that customers want to hear from each other. The technology, let's say, is kind of the
easy part. As overwhelming as it is, that's kind of the easy part. It's really unlocking the use case that customers
want to learn from each other on. So, we're excited about the organization and how we're set up. It's yielding
great results.
And I think that's the wrap for me. So again, I thank you for giving us the opportunity today to talk to you. It's my
honor and privilege to be in front of you as the new CRO. 80 days in, I've got a certain accountability on my
shoulders, which is to continue to give you great earnings on a quarterly basis, which I'm dead set on doing. And
we feel really, really good about the trajectory we're on. And we also feel really great about the vibe and the
community of customers and partners coming out to this conference and hopefully you see and feel that too
firsthand. So, thank you. [ph] Are we staying (01:23:15) here.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
John DiFucci Q
Analyst, Guggenheim Securities LLC
Hi, it's John DiFucci from Guggenheim. And question is sort of for Sridhar and Christian. So, you both talked a lot
about unstructured data in AI and you've also been clear on the conference calls that the strength in the business
is really from the core data warehouse and analytics business. So, I'm just trying to understand, like all the work
you're doing and Sridhar you come, like Christian, like at least as long as I've known you, you've been here, and
that's what I think of you and Sridhar I know you come from a different world. I'm just curious if you feel like you're
there now where you can sort of play on a level playing field against, which at least perceived as you being the
data warehouse in the cloud vendor. And there's a lot left there and your competitor Databricks, [ph] I'd say it
(01:24:28), because Christian did, is really viewed as the data science company? Is it more just perception now or
is there still work you need to do on the product side? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Gosh, there's a lot to unpack in your question. What we have consistently said is that we have incredible strength
in the Analytics side of the business. It's the foundation, as evidenced by our continued growth, things like our net
retention rates. And that our newer product efforts, whether it's in the earlier phases of the data cycle when it
comes to things like ingestion, early data engineering workloads that they're gaining strength as well as in areas
like AI. And this idea that AI is the purview of a data scientist, is very 2020. Because AI is now the purview of the
CEO because they want real transformation to happen. And similarly, when if – like, if you're the chief data officer
at a company, you want to use everything possible in order to drive the kind of outcomes that you are looking for.
And just as a matter of like practicality, unstructured data was harder to deal with before. But no one in their right
mind says, I want to write a lot of code in a notebook on files that are sitting in S3 for me to understand what a
piece of text meant. And what we are able to do instead is tell them you can using OpenFlow connect Snowflake
to a SharePoint repository, have data flow in, be able to create an index on it. These are as one configuration
screen, one command, and all of a sudden you have an interactive chat bot in the data that you can drop into a
data agent which now knows how to intelligently choose from, does it go against a client data set or does it look at
the unstructured data? And so, with respect to capability, I feel very confident about where we are? And if
anything, I would say with things like our marketplace or the knowledge extension of the stuff that you saw today,
we are leapfrogging because, again, no one wants complexity, they want outcomes.

Brad Zelnick Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Hey, guys. Brad Zelnick, Deutsche Bank. Really great event and the innovation and customer success is
palpable. Christian, I tuned into something specific that you said when you were talking about Gen2 and Adaptive,
answering the age old question or speaking to the age old question of separating performance from revenue
impact where Snowflake gets to keep some of the value and avoids becoming the next Teradata. And I'm trying to
reconcile that with open data formats and AI helping to reduce switching costs for customers and I may have
missed the point, but why isn't competition and lower switching costs going to dictate price?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Kleinerman A
Executive Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc.
To a degree, it's not competition. How I framed it was, we want to be the leader in price performance, which is
why my statement is, if any of you goes and update models and say, oh, we're not going to go get the
performance headwinds, now that would be the wrong conclusion. That's why I was very clear on that. No, no, we
will still continue to pass on benefits to our customers. But what we did with both Gen2 and Adaptive is, now we're
in control of when and how much and what's really going to guide it is our position on the price performance
leaderboard. That's how we think about it. If we need to go pass it all overnight, the way we've always done, we
can do it. But if we don't have to, we don't have to. Does that help?

It helps. Thank you.

Alex Zukin Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hey, guys. Right next to Brad, Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. I want to maybe ask from a little bit of a different
lens. You've got too tech questions. It does feel like the vibes are different at this conference this year. It feels like
the spend intensity, it feels like the demand environment, feels like something has changed. And I'm curious, is it
as simple as, hey, these AI budgets are having downstream significant impacts, customers are realizing that they
build AI on data, not on models and Snowflake is – and your peers are both kind of rising tide benefiting or is
there – is it a product intensity, innovation velocity that the folks are like – is reinvigorated by that you can attribute
to? And then maybe just explain kind of the PostgreSQL moves and why this is a really important part of the
dynamic this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Lots, lots to unpack. I'll start on the first part and Christian will speak – add on and speak to PostgreSQL. There's
always feedback loops in life, where your team, you yourself feel like work that you are doing is having a positive
impact, that spurs more work because you can see that positive impact. And I'm open – I've been open about the
fact that we went through a tough phase last year. But I'm pretty proud of the fact that, like, we stood up to it and
produced better outcomes. With the things that we knew best, which is the hard work in sales to get things landed
to deliver value. And then the things on the product side to create world class products and then do the hard,
sweaty work of telling every customer about it. To this day, whenever I meet a customer, I tell them, you should
let us do a half day workshop. It'll cost you nothing. It'll show you what's possible with Snowflake and AI. And then
we'll talk about where we can create value.

But thanks to things like that, I think there is a real momentum for Snowflake, both inside and outside the
company where the team believes they're headed to a better future. And all of our customers have the same
belief as well. Remember what I told you folks earlier? Every person that's betting on snowflakes, it's kind of
betting their career on Snowflake. And the more they see, oh, wow, here are all the other things that I can get
done as a result of my bet on Snowflake. And in fact, it's going to help me navigate the AI wave as opposed to me
having to stitch stuff and answer awkward questions about what I'm doing with AI, Snowflake is very much a part
of it. I think that's the message that you see resonating now with every constituent. And you see this outside, you
see this in the announcements. And we get customer feedback from tons of people, including you folks that
helpfully compile feedback and send it to us. And so, we see it in that as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Kleinerman A
Executive Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah, briefly. I think the journey customers have been on is also informing how some of the items that we say
resonate. A year ago, we said there's no AI strategy without data strategy. And so, we would say, oh, that's
because you have nothing in AI. We also said, oh, you want your AI to respect your governance and governance
matters and permissions matter. And people [ph] are like (01:32:28), AI, I can put my ChatGPT on the data. Then
you realize all these things are true. And that's where the post-risk conversation comes in.
So, I want to be able to store state. I want to be able to personalize my agent. Where do you do that? That's with
all this. So, I think there's been a – I don't know if it's – maybe it's the hype cycle, but a point where people now
have tried to roll out AI. And they realize that many of our core thesis is true, governance matters, not taking data
out matters, not making copy matters. And I think that's what you see reflected now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
And being world class is essential. You folks know this. We have now gone through what appears to be, what,
three generations of vector databases. And these are all companies that reported to be the next Snowflake. I
mean, I wish them well, but a vector database is much better as an addition to Snowflake where it's like one
command to create an index. So, we have to walk the walk and that's where we're able to lead with then the
strength of what we as a data platform offer.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Gannon A
Chief Revenue Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
And I think you also, you look at the customer stories that we're starting to generate and I talk about that supplier
organization where we unlocked tremendous value for them, where their bid officer can put together 100 bids a
day versus one every three days. Those stories are getting out there. Customers talk to each other. And that's the
most powerful sales force I have as my customers. When they talk about the success of what we've unlocked for
them, right, the ease of use to connective tissue, the trust, right. Those stories are probably my greatest sales
assets out there, but it's also how my team shows up, right. And we show up talking about the technology. We've
already – I won't say we've lost it. That's the rocket science. That's kind of the easy part. It's how we help
customers think about, right, their processing of the data, the people, right, the business ideas that are going to
inspire the next revenue stream. That's a conversation we have to start with and I feel like we tend to end there.
So, I want to change the way we show up for our customers and have outcome discussions, so we can unlock
value, we can show them great reference use cases and then we get deep in the tech and we have to validate it.

Investor Day 03-Jun-2025
Thanks very much, Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. If you came here a few years ago, I think it used to be, we
would talk about data warehousing and there's always importance of data, but it seems today that through the
simplicity of the platform, you all are able to talk about solutions and business outcomes. And the question is
really, are the people you're talking to today versus three or four years ago different in terms of their ability to
make bit higher level decisions, work – move faster with you, meaning it used to be sort of, well, we'll move one
data set at a time, are they looking to move at a faster pace because they now understand the business
relevance of all this? And I guess for you, Mike, how much farther do you have to go in terms of specialization,
whether it's verticalization? I'd also just love you to just chime in really quickly on Europe and what you're doing
internationally, where you're still obviously a lot to go there? Thanks, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Gannon A
Chief Revenue Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
So, I can't speak for last year in terms of the buying profile and meetings we've been on. But I can tell you within
the first 35 customers I met with, I think only one of the meetings had the chief technology [ph] officer in
(01:35:50) the discussion. It was lines of business. He was the CEO of a large publishing company in New York
who want to have a discussion around, tell me how I can monetize and commercialize my data.
So, again, how we show up and the people we're talking to are people that are trying to drive new revenue
streams and optimize the organization. In terms of the investment specialization, we have foundational people in
place today. We are definitely going to be investing more in those specialized business analysts or specialists, as
well as data specialists that we can show up and not only talk about the business outcome, but actually have
people prototyping, within a couple of days how we can unlock value and showcase, that outcome and how we
can actually let the data unlock value? Europe and APJ are two growth markets for us, right. Those are my fastest
growing markets. Again, a large portion of our revenue still comes from US. We're investing heavily in Europe and
APJ. Europe, we've got a European leader that just onboarded. We've got 23 new managers.
So, we're expanding. It's obviously 138 countries we have to cover. We've got a great base of individuals there.
Again, my ramp-up in productivity is my primary interest in those markets. How quickly are we bringing on people
to those markets and how quickly are they being productive and having a business outcome discussion and then
bring in the technology discussion to marry it up. Same goes for APJ. Those are unbelievable growth markets for
me.

Brent A. Bracelin Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good afternoon. Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. I wanted to go back to the pricing conversation around Gen2.
What's the right value capture for 2x higher performance? Can you capture 20% higher priced for 2x higher
performance? Is that the right way to think about it, one? And then two, maybe more importantly, what portion of
the installed base is performance, the number one priority? Is this something that maybe half of the installed
base, as you contemplate, might move to Gen2 versus sticking with the Gen1? Or is it more of the installed base
that potentially would move towards kind of Gen2 and eventually these Adaptive tiers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Kleinerman A
Executive Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc.
So, two thoughts, Brent. One is the price incremental from Gen 1 to Gen 2, that's a fixed ratio. That's the easy
part of the equation. The benefit is not the same for everyone. And that's where it gets difficult. And that's why I
said, hey, the benchmark on the number I'm sharing, it's representative for some workload, but for example, if
24

Investor Day 03-Jun-2025
someone has an update-heavy workload, they'll see numbers way better than what's in here. If it's a workload that
is more read-only, they'll see slightly lower than that.
So, that's the piece that makes it hard. We've calibrated in a way that customers will for sure see better price
performance and ideally see a economic benefit relative to where they are, because it's always easier for us to
lower it later if we want to deliver more back to the us being in control on the when and how much, going up is
always a complicated.
So, I don't know that there's an easy yes. This is the split because it's a customer by customer conversation.
We're starting at a point where we think is conservative and roughly revenue neutral or a little bit lower and then
we can go and adjust based on what we see. But the performance is going to be materially, materially better for
pretty much all of our customers. My expectation is that everyone is on Gen2 or everyone like 90%, 95%, 95%.
The large percentage of our customers are there within months.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
The only thing I'll add on to this is that there are second order effects from performance improvements because
people are willing to do a lot more things, finish faster, they're able to get more work done for the same unit
amount of either time or the dollar that they put in and it's our ability to roll these out that is more important than
exactly how much performance because, as Christian said, that varies depending on the workload.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Kleinerman A
Executive Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc.
And I think that's a great point, which also talks about your second part of your question on sensitivity to
performance. I think the willingness to open or bring new use cases to Snowflake are influenced by that. I just met
with someone after the keynote. A large company said, given some parameters, I'm going to use my internal
customer support agents like internal traffic on Snowflake. If the latency is lower than some other thing, I'm going
to put it customer facing.

Kash Rangan Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
[ph] I got back to you (01:41:12), Mike, to say something while posing with a question on the mic. Scarpelli, I will
spare you of the question, and Mark Murphy challenged me to keep my question to one question. So, let me see
if I can win the bet. It's a glass of wine, Mark. Consumer tech hides all the complexity. And you've seen OpenAI,
you had Sam Altman, it has had so much massive adoption captured the world's imagination in such a short span
of time. And Sridhar, you've been in consumer tech before, Google, Christian, you too. Why has the magic of
Generative AI or maybe there is a magic formula that Snowflake has? It is a question I've been asking other
CEOs as well. Why has it taken so long in enterprise with respect to adoption of AI? And what do you think is the
key to unlocking the magic that ChatGPT and other consumer apps have unleashed in the consumer world?
Thank you so much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah, it's a great question. Well, first of all, I would say that when it comes to things like meeting preparation,
when it comes to a lot of things that we do commonly, I think Generative AI has basically penetrated most
companies, most of our consciousness. We all get the utility of it. But until we launched Anthropic Inside
Snowflake, for example, obviously, you can't take something that's confidential and put it into ChatGPT, even if
you're paying for a subscription. I think it is easy to use products like Snowflake Intelligence that don't require you
to make compromises. But I think are truly going to unlock large scale use. OpenAI is doing a little bit of it. They
have a set of enterprise deals for their enterprise products that are driving broad adoption. But to me, the magic of
AI in the enterprise is going to come from all of the datasets that matter to you, whether it's sales information,
consumption information, HR information or stuff that's sitting on Drive or Dox or Dropbox. When all of that
becomes accessible, I think that's when the magic truly unfolds and that's what we're excited to be driving. I don't
think it's that far away, Kash.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Kleinerman A
Executive Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc.
I would add one quick thing. I also agree it's not far away. But I also think the tolerance for incorrect results is
lower in a consumer world than the enterprise world. Like we all remember the original ChatGPT. It was
hallucination, left and right. And it was okay. In the enterprise that is less okay. And a lot of what we're sharing
here at the conference and in our overall strategy is how do you do AI but with a trusted piece that Mike Gannon
talked about that is the piece and I think they're all finally coming together. Now you [ph] had the experience in
public (01:44:16) intelligence, as Sridhar said. So, the time is near.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Gannon A
Chief Revenue Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
And I think there's a great – most executives worry that they don't have the prerequisite skills they need to drive
an AI strategy. And that's one of the things that I'm most excited about is kind of simplifying, right? We can help
solve this for you, let's talk about business concepts first. We'll make the tech the easy part. But I think there's
also generally a skills discussion that most executives are worried about. And secondly, to what Christian said
right security, data privacy. Let's make sure we have all those controls in place. That's truly important because we
all know, we have been around tech long enough, when it comes to warehousing, garbage in, garbage out, what
data is going to be most critically important data but accurate data that we're going to build our models on. We're
spending a lot of time talking with customers around the data and the governance of the day that goes into the
platform. And then obviously spending a lot of time talking about how simple, large language models can make

unlocking data or unlocking value from that data really simple and easy to understand. So I think it's skills and I
think it's privacy security.

Karl E. Keirstead Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Karl Keirstead at UBS. Sridhar, what do you think of the SaaS firm's moving into the data layer? Obviously
Salesforce derives $800 million-ish from data cloud now, just offered to buy Informatica for $8 billion. Bill
McDermott at ServiceNow talks about workflow data fabric. SAP is pushing their business data cloud. So what's
the signal there, in your judgment that we should all recognize? And in particular, are there data use cases that in
your judgment, the SaaS vendors, have a legit shot at winning? And conversely, are there use cases that will
never truly go to the SaaS vendors that need to go to data specialists like Snowflake?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
It's a great question. And we spend a lot of time debating this question. I think a lot of their behavior is driven by
AI. I think in the case of SaaS vendors that makes software that assists humans in getting things done. Customer
service is a classic example. I think there's an existential risk to that model of making that kind of software, which
is the software that is based on things like agentic AI, can be a wholesale replacement for not only like the
software that they make, but also the people that are doing this. And so, I think for a number of SaaS companies
getting into agentic AI is not an add-on to their business model, it's a threat to their business model. I think that in
my mind exemplifies the interest that they have in the area and why data becomes so important.
Look, we collaborate actively with all of these folks. We have bidirectional data sharing with Salesforce, with
ServiceNow. And we are working on a close partnership with SAP. And what we offer is a place, where all data
can be brought into one place. That's what we do, we are very good as a data platform, it's a hard skill, just like
making a model that is world-class is a hard skill that is – that only some companies can truly be world-class at. I
think building a general purpose data platform is very different from building a SaaS application and that's
something that we are very good at.
I think the kind of use cases that you will see SaaS companies capture will be along the lines of what I described,
which is agentic versions like insight into data about processes that they drive, generally speaking. Obviously they
have bigger aspirations and part of the reason why we make this bi-directional is we want – we need these
partnerships to be win-win. So that they feel like they're getting what they want out of it as well and so you can
move data from Snowflake on to one of these – one of these data cloud. But we feel confident about the value-
add that we bring to the table as that central place that can offer the 360 view, be able to act on it and I see
interoperability happen at multiple levels with fabric. For example, we collaborate at a bottom level, where we are
able to read a table that is sitting in – that is sitting in one leg or somebody that is in Snowflake can say, hey, I
want to store this table in one lake. We also work with them at the top level of agent components that are created
with Snowflake Intelligence will interoperate at that level. So, you're going to find this kind of cooperation and
competition at both of these levels.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Kleinerman A
Executive Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc.
I'll add one thing. Hi, Karl. Most organizations have two or more of these SaaS applications. Which creates a
problem because Benioff says oh, you want to combine our data and data you have with Salesforce [ph] with the
rest of your data (01:49:56) give me the rest of your data and then McDermott an hour later goes and says the
exact same thing. And you have CIOs, CPOs and CDOs saying, you want me to copy all of my data into these

different platforms? That's a massive no, no from efficiency, cost, governance, et cetera, I talked to a CTO of a
bank recently and said there's no way I'm going to go open my data multiple times in one or each of these
platforms. I think that is the single biggest gap in that thinking.

Thank you both.

Mark R. Murphy Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Mark Murphy with JPMorgan right here in front. Mike Gannon, I wanted to ask you, great presentation, by the
way. You mentioned it, but the number of sales and marketing hires in Q1 was rather stunning. When you look at
the history and the sequencing. Can you clarify how much of that, reflects just there's been a step-up in the
pipeline, right. So we need feet on the street to go get it versus maybe you coming in and saying, our ratios have
been off, for a while. And then can you speak to that type of hire, should we look at that and say, well, these were
the specialist hires coming in, where they would take a while to ramp? Should we look at it and say, these are
people – you're bringing in people that sell further up the totem pole, it would take longer to ramp.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah. I'll just provide one bit of historical context and Mike will answer the question. I want to make sure that all of
you juxtapose the hiring numbers that you saw in Q3 and Q4 with the numbers in Q1. We went through a period
of just cleaning house, we called it a get fit initiative where we really focused on accountability and performance.
That was an ongoing thing. And then it was combined with the numbers that came out in Q1, that context is
important for you to remember.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Gannon A
Chief Revenue Officer, Snowflake, Inc.
Yeah, it's a great question, though. 70% of those new hires were additional capacity, 30% was really what I'd say
performance management people that were just complacently sitting back waiting for business to show up on
their lap. So that was a large part of the activities that happened in Q3 and Q4 of last year.
In terms of the question about the hiring profile, we're actually leveraging, some modeling right now. We're looking
at our most productive reps, the reps that are consistently overachieving and we're actually scraping through
LinkedIn to figure out the hiring profile, what's the most common, most successful backgrounds that these
individuals are showcasing because that then becomes the new informed profile of the rep that's going to carry us
into this data and AI space.
We're spending a lot of time. We're a data company. We do this really well, where we actually can do a lot of
intelligence gathering on the most productive reps and frankly, even the reps that are maybe struggling, there's a
consistent profile we see there. So, we're spending a lot of time looking at this. I mean, productivity to me in this
space that is moving at a blistering pace, we can't afford to mis-hire. So we're spending a lot of time on not only
just getting the right people hired. That's critically important step one. And then step two is leveraging the
productivity tools that I talked about around Snowflake Intelligence to get them productive within six months as
opposed to what historically may have taken a year. But in terms of the growth projections we've put out onto the
market, that's all been factored in, based on the capacity I share with you just now, that has been factored into the
results that you're expecting to see for the rest of this year.

Gregg Moskowitz Q
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC
Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Christian, just getting back to the notion of keeping some of the value for adaptive
compute specifically. Some of our conversations with partners and customers have indicated an expectation of a
significant cost savings just because they can purchase smaller clusters and flex them. I completely appreciate
that this should drive more consumption on the platform, which is terrific, right. But might we see an initial revenue
reset once we get to the point of adaptive being GA? How are you sort of thinking about this?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Kleinerman A
Executive Vice President-Product, Snowflake, Inc.
We have not finalized the pricing level of adaptive. One of the reasons why I caveated that we are going to go
slow and see how this works. Part of it is a technical reason, but the other one is we want to make sure that we
understand that consolidation effect. Right now, all the guidance and numbers that we provided are factoring all
the information that we have and we do not expect to go in and see the top line change dramatically because of
this. We believe that a lot of the value of adaptive comes from the ease of management, the TCO, et cetera, not
necessarily because we need to go and effectively lower the price.

Patrick Colville Q
Analyst, Scotiabank
All right, Patrick Colville here from Scotia. I'll make it a good one, Jimmy. So two years ago at Summit, I mean,
you coined the AI and data cloud message. I mean, back then it was like right at the beginning, this kind of AI
adoption. I mean, we're a bit further along now and we're starting to get a sense of these kind of reference
architectures now. Like you can't walk one block in San Francisco without talking about MCP. You guys and your
closest peer bought a Postgres database, OpenAI was on stage yesterday. Sridhar you're very deep in this
ecosystem, I guess, where do you see the AI reference architecture as of today and where will evolve to in 12
months and where can Snowflake kind of move towards the puck, where it's going in 12 months?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sridhar Ramaswamy A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Snowflake, Inc.
It's a great question. I think, foundation models continue to evolve their capabilities rapidly. And I think what they
are able to achieve with post-training, achieve with some amount of time, like what they can do with deep
research is I think truly, truly remarkable. I continue to be blown away by how that kind of tech is able to do so
much, just acting on the open web, but from an enterprise context, I genuinely think that having these world-class
models then paired up with the right sources of enterprise data, with the right reference architectures for
interactive applications, which are fundamentally just incredibly different from here do some research for me and
it's fine, if you take 10 minutes. Those are just not the same things. I think that's the stuff that'll get settled over the
next few quarters.

So at one level, yes, we want AI SQL to happen because that is data processing at scale, where you are able to
crunch through a million rows. And whether you take 3 minutes or 4 minutes doesn't quite matter. On the other
hand, if you are building an interactive chat bot that you want to power customer support, then every decision,
how long that search index takes, what's the right sized model? You don't want to go pick the biggest model for
that one because it's no longer quite so interactive or what's the underlying store for analytic queries but now
being served out in real time because you want that data fast.
I think those are the knobs that are going to get tuned over the next few quarters. And that's also how we
internally think about this, part of what like even with Cortex analyst, it takes a few seconds to give an answer, but
it cannot be that way if I truly want all of you to be able to use it freely and fluidly, what are the kinds of things that
you want to do? I think there'll be a set of these foundational components. There will be things like tool calling. I
think Web search continues to be a really powerful repository for anything that is recent, anything that is not part
of your enterprise scope. I see very much composite tooling coming in, which knows what to talk to where. So,
where we need to partner for these cases, we will absolutely partner. We will continue to partner with the
foundation model labs that continue to outpace others, in terms of what they're able to bring. But when it comes to
all of the data, that is proprietary to enterprises that matters to enterprises, we feel very good about being able to
figure out what's the kind of product and interaction model that is needed for them to be effective in creating
products for enterprise use. And that's what we're driving towards.
Jimmy, come on up. I think we're done.

Jimmy L. Sexton

Thanks so much, everyone. Katherine and I will be hanging out after to answer some questions, but they have to
go to a customer event, unfortunately.

Olivier Pomel
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Thanks, Yuka, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning to go through our results for Q2.
Let me begin with this quarter's business drivers. Overall, we saw trends for usage growth from existing
customers in Q2 that were higher than our expectations. We experienced strong growth in our AI-native cohort.
The number of AI-native customers are growing meaningfully with us, as they see rapid usage growth with their
products.
Meanwhile, we saw consistent and steady usage growth in the rest of the business. We continue to see the
overall demand environment as solid with an ongoing healthy pace of cloud migration and digital transformation.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 07-Aug-2025
And churn has remained low with gross revenue retention stable in the mid to high 90s, highlighting the mission-
critical nature of our platform for our customers.
Regarding our Q2 financial performance and key metrics, revenue was $827 million, an increase of 28% year-
over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended Q2 with about 31,400 customers, up from
about 28,700 a year ago. This includes about 150 new customers from our Eppo and Metaplan acquisitions.
We ended Q2 with about 3,850 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about 3,390 a year ago,
and these customers generated about 89% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of $165 million with a
free cash flow margin of 20%.
Turning to platform adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. At the end of Q2, 83% of
customers were using two or more products, the same as last year. 52% of customers were using four or more
products, up from 49% a year ago. 29% of our customers were using six or more products, up from 25% a year
ago, and 14% of our customers were using eight or more products, up from 11% a year ago. So our customers
continue to adopt more products, including our security offerings.
As a reminder, our security customers can identify and manage vulnerabilities, with Code Security, Cloud
Security, and Sensitive Data Scanner, and they can detect and protect from attacks with App & API Protection,
Workload Protection and Cloud SIEM.
We are pleased that our security suite of product now generates over $100 million in ARR and is growing mid-40s
percent year-over-year. While we are pleased to achieve this milestone, we are still just getting started in solving
customer problems in this area with new innovations such as our Bits AI Security Analyst.
Moving on to R&D. We held our DASH user conference in June, where we announced over 125 exciting new
products and features for our users. So let's go through some of the announcements.
First, we launched fully autonomous AI agents, including Bits AI SRE Agent to investigate alerts and coordinate
incident response; Bits AI Dev Agent, an AI-powered coding assistant to proactively fix production issues; and
Bits AI Security Analyst to triage Datadog Cloud SIEM signals.
To further accelerate our users' incident response, we announced AI voice agent for incident response so users
can quickly get up to speed and start taking action on their phones. We also announced handoff notifications that
make it easy to jump straight into the relevant context and quickly communicate with our responders, and status
pages to enable automatic updates for customers who undergo an incident.
Second, we delivered a series of products to help customers ship better software with confidence. With the
Datadog Internal Developer Portal, developers can ship better and faster by gaining a real-time view into their
software systems and APIs with their software catalog by provisioning infrastructure, scaffolding new services,
and managing code changes and deployments with self-service action, and by following engineering and
readiness standards with Scorecards.
We launched a Datadog MCP Server to enable AI agents to access telemetry from Datadog and to act as a
bridge between Datadog and MCP compatible AI agents, like OpenAI Codex, Cursor and Claude Code from
Anthropic. We work together with OpenAI to integrate our MCP server within the OpenAI Codex CLI, and the
Datadog Cursor extension now gives developers access to Datadog tools and observability data directly within
the Cursor IDE.

Third, we are reimagining observability to meet our customers' increasingly complex needs. Our APM Latency
Investigator formulates and explores hypothesis in the background, helping teams to quickly isolate root causes
and understand impact without combing through large amounts of data. Proactive app recommendations help
users stay ahead of growing system complexity by analyzing APM data to detect issues and propose fixes before
they become problems.
We announced our Flex Frozen Tier, so customers can keep logs in fully managed storage for up to seven years
and be able to search without data movement or rehydration. Archive Search now enables teams to query archive
logs directly in cloud storage, like Amazon S3 bucket or in the Flex Frozen Tier, and Datadog now supports
advanced data analysis features within Notebooks.
Fourth, our security products cover new AI attack vectors across the application, model and data layers. At the AI
data layer, Sensitive Data Scanner can now prevent the leakage of sensitive data and training data as well as
LLM prompts and responses. At the model layer, we help secure against supply chain attacks in open source
models and prevent model hijacking attacks. At the application layer, we help prevent prompt injection attacks
and data poisoning in runtime.
And finally, we showcased our new end-to-end AI and data observability capabilities. Engineers and machine
learning teams can use GPU monitoring to gain visibility into GPU fleets across cloud, on-prem and GPU-as-a-
Service platforms such as CoreWeave and Lambda Labs. With AI Agents Console, enterprises can monitor the
behavior and interactions of any AI agent used by their teams.
We now offer LLM Observability Experiments to help understand how changes to prompts, models or AI providers
influence applications outcomes. We added a new agentic flows visualization to LLM Observability to capture and
understand the decision path of AI agent.
And last but not least, and accelerated by our recent acquisitions of Metaplan, Datadog now offers a complete
approach to data observability across the entire data lifecycle, from iteration to transformation, to downstream
usage.
So, we continue to relentlessly innovate to solve more problems for our customers. In doing so, we are being
rightfully recognized by independent research, and we are pleased that for the fifth year in a row, Datadog has
been named as a leader in the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Observability Platforms. We believe that this
validates our approach to deliver a unified platform which breaks down silos across teams.
Now let's move on to sales and marketing. We had a number of great new logo wins and customer expansions
this quarter. So let's go through a few of those.
First, we signed a seven-figure annualized expansion in a three-year contract worth more than $60 million with
one of the world's largest banks. This company believes getting to the cloud is essential so they can use AI on
their extremely rich dataset to improve how they manage risk and serve their customers. They are using Datadog
as their strategic cloud observability platform, and they continue to migrate more applications to the cloud. This
customer is expanding to 21 Datadog products, with thousands of users who log into the Datadog platform every
month.
Next, we signed a seven-figure expansion to an eight-figure annualized contract with a leading US insurance
company. Datadog is supporting this customer's efforts to consolidate observability tools and expand their cloud-

based products. By adopting Datadog, they are experiencing fewer and less severe incidents, with estimated
savings of over $9 million per year in incident response costs and improving more than 100,000 customer
transactions that would otherwise be impacted every year. With this expansion, this customer will adopt 19
Datadog products and will consolidate a couple dozen tools across multiple business units.
Next, we signed a nearly seven-figure annualized expansion with a leading American media conglomerate. This
customer has about 100 observability tools across more than 300 business units, and this tool fragmentation has
resulted in inefficiencies, in extra costs, and lost engineering time. They are expanding to 21 Datadog products,
including all of our security products, and replacing their paging solution with Datadog On-Call and Incident
Management.
Next, we landed a seven-figure annualized deal with a leading Brazilian e-commerce company. This customer's
previous observability vendor was unable to support them as they moved to newer software platforms and
modern cloud infrastructure. By replacing this tool with Datadog, the company was able to gain full visibility into its
cloud tech stack and saw significant improvements in application stability and incident resolution times. This
customer will start with seven Datadog products, including Flex Logs.
Next, we landed a seven-figure annualized deal with a delivery app of a major American retailer. This customer
found our RUM and Error Tracking products to be immediately valuable, finding an issue on the first day of their
Datadog trial that they hadn't identified after months of searching with their old tool. By adopting Datadog with
seven products to start, this customer will consolidate half a dozen tools while meeting their PCI compliance
requirements.
Finally, we welcomed back a leading US mortgage company in a nearly seven-figure annualized deal. This
customer had moved to using a dozen open source disconnected tools, which led to fragmented visibility, alert
fatigue, and poor customer experience. In returning to Datadog, they plan to adopt six products, including
replacing their paging system with Datadog On-Call. And that's it for another productive quarter from our go-to-
market teams, who are now very hard at work on a busy Q3.
Before I turn it over to David for a financial review, I want to say a few words on our longer-term outlook. There's
no change to our overall view that digital transformation and cloud migration are long-term secular growth drivers
of our business.
As we think about AI, we are incredibly excited about our opportunities. First, AI is a tailwind for Datadog, as
increased cloud consumption drives more usage of our platform. Today, we see this primarily in our AI-native
group of customers, who are monitoring their cloud-native applications with us. There are hundreds of customers
in this group. They include more than a dozen that are spending over $1 million a year with us and more than 80
who are spending more than $100,000. And they include 8 of the top 10 leading AI companies.
While we know there's a lot of attention on this cohort, we primarily see it as an indication of what's to come, as
companies of every size and every single industry incorporate AI into their cloud applications. And we continue to
see rising customer interest for next-gen AI observability and analysis. Today, over 4,500 customers use one or
more Datadog AI integrations.
Second, next-gen AI introduces new complexity and new observability challenges. Our AI Observability products
help our customers gain visibility and deploy with confidence across their entire AI stack, including GPU
monitoring, LLM observability, AI agent observability, and data observability. And we will, of course, keep
innovating as the AI landscape develops further.

Third, we are incorporating AI into the Datadog platform to deliver more value to our customers. As I discussed
earlier, we launched Bits AI SRE Agent, Dev Agent and Security Agent. We are seeing very good results with
those with more improvements and new capabilities to come.
Finally, as a SaaS platform focused on our customers' critical workflows, we have a large volume of rich, clean
and detailed data, which allows us to conduct groundbreaking research. A great example of that is our Toto
foundational model for time series forecasting, which shows state-of-the-art performance on all benchmarks, even
going well beyond specialized observability use cases. And you should expect to see more from us on that front in
the future as well as taking novel research approaches and models straight into our products to improve customer
outcomes.
So we are extremely excited about our progress so far against what we expect to be a generational growth
opportunity. In other words, we're just getting started.
And with that, I will turn it over to our CFO. David?

David M. Obstler
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Thanks, Olivier. Q2 revenue was $827 million, up 28% year-over-year and up 9% quarter-over-quarter.
Now, to dive into some of the drivers of this Q2 revenue growth, first, overall, we saw trends for usage growth
from existing customers in Q2 that were higher than our expectations. This included strong growth in our AI-native
cohort as well as usage growth from the rest of the business that was consistent with recent quarters amidst a
healthy and steady cloud migration environment.
We saw a continued rise in contribution from AI-native customers in the quarter, who represented about 11% of
Q2 revenues, up from 8% of revenues in the last quarter and about 4% of revenues in the year ago quarter. The
AI-native customers contributed about 10 points of year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 versus about 6 points
last quarter and about 2 points in the year ago quarter.
Now, as previously discussed, we do see revenue concentration in this cohort in recent quarters. But if we look at
our revenue without the largest customer in the AI-native cohort, our year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 was
stable relative to Q1. We remain mindful that we may see volatility in our revenue growth on the backdrop of long-
term volume growth in this cohort, as customers renew with us on different terms and as they may choose to
optimize cloud and observability usage over time.
As you heard from Oli, we continue to believe that adoption of AI will benefit Datadog in the long term, and we
believe that the growth of this AI-native customer group is an indication of the opportunity to come, as AI is
adopted more broadly and customers outside the AI-native group begin to operate AI workloads in production.
Now, regarding usage growth by customer segment, in Q2, our year-over-year usage growth was fairly similar
across segments relative to previous quarters, as SMB and mid-market usage growth improved in Q2, while
enterprise customer usage growth remained roughly stable. Note that we are excluding the AI-native cohort for
the purposes of this commentary. And as a reminder, we define enterprise as customers with 5,000 or more
employees, mid-market as customers with 1,000 to 5,000 employees, and SMB as customers with less than
1,000 employees.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 07-Aug-2025
Regarding our retention metrics, our 12-month trailing net retention percentage was about 120%, higher than the
high 110s last quarter. And our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention percentage remains in the mid- to high
90s.
Now, moving on to our financial results, first, billings were $852 million, up 20% year-over-year and remaining
performance obligations, or RPO, was $2.43 billion, up 35% year-over-year. Our current RPI growth was in the
low 30s year-over-year and our RPO duration was up slightly year-over-year.
As previously mentioned, we continue to believe that revenue is a better indication of our business trends than
billings and RPO, as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of
customer contracts.
And now, let's review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-
GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release.
First, gross profit in the quarter was $669 million for a gross margin of 80.9%. This compares to a gross margin of
80.3% last quarter and 82.1% in the year ago quarter.
As we've discussed in the last call, we saw an increasing impact of our engineers' cost savings efforts throughout
this quarter, as they delivered on cloud efficiency projects. And we are continuing our focus on cloud efficiency
and believe that we have further opportunity for gross margin improvement in the second half of the year.
Our Q2 OpEx grew 30% year-over-year, up from 29% last quarter. As we've communicated over the past year,
we plan to grow our investments to pursue our long-term growth opportunities and this OpEx growth is an
indication of our execution on our hiring plans. Q2 operating income was $164 million for a 20% operating margin
compared to 22% last quarter and 24% in the year ago quarter. Within that, as we've noted, we held our DASH
user conference in June. And as expected, the event cost $13 million.
We also experienced a rising impact from the weaker dollar and absorbed $6 million of negative FX impact during
Q2. Excluding those expenses, operating income would have been 22% in Q2 or 200 basis points higher.
And now, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $3.9 billion in cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities, and our cash flow from operations was $200 million in the quarter.
After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $165 million for a
free cash flow margin of 20%.
And now, for our outlook for the third quarter and the remainder of fiscal 2025. First, our guidance philosophy
overall remains unchanged. As a reminder, we base our guidance on recent trends observed and apply
conservatism on these growth trends. For the third quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $847 million
to $851 million, which represents a 23% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in
the range of $176 million to $180 million, which implies an operating margin of 21%, and non-GAAP net income
per share is expected to be $0.44 to $0.46 per share based on approximately 364 million weighted average
diluted shares outstanding.
For fiscal 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $3.312 billion to $3.322 billion, which represents a 23%
to 24% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $684 million to $694
million, which implies an operating margin of 21%, and non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the
range of $1.80 to $1.83 per share, based on approximately $364 million (sic) [364 million] average diluted shares.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 07-Aug-2025
Some additional notes on our guidance. We expect net interest and other income for fiscal 2025 to be
approximately $150 million. And due to the impact of the recent federal tax legislation, we now expect cash taxes
for 2025 to be about $10 million to $20 million. We continue to apply a 21% non-GAAP tax rate for 2025 and
going forward. And finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be 4% to 5% of
revenues in fiscal year 2025.
To summarize, we are pleased with our execution in Q2, including the many products and features we launched
at DASH. We are well positioned to help our existing and prospective customers with their cloud migration and
digital transformation journeys, including their adoption of AI. I want to thank all Datadogs worldwide for their
efforts.
And with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin our Q&A.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays.
Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raimo Lenschow Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Perfect. Thank you. Two quick questions from me. Olivier, like you talked about the AI contribution and to slowly
broadening out. How should we think about it in terms of when this goes much broader into inference, et cetera?
So does that everyone like Barclays, JPMorgan, et cetera, they all kind of need to do more around observability
because they're going to do more inference, et cetera? So in a way, like OpenAI, et cetera, is just setting the
scene for future. And what do you think about the market opportunity there?
And then, David, in the second half of last year, you hired a lot of extra sales guys. Can you talk a little bit about
that ramp and where they are in their productivity curve? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. On the AI opportunity, so there's really multiple layers to it. The first layer is, largely what we see today,
which is companies that are running their inference stack and the application around it, in cloud environments. So
that's the case of the model makers or if you think of the companies that are doing coding agents, things like that.
That is what we see today. And it looks a lot like normal compute. So you have normal machine CPUs, some
GPUs, quite a few other components, databases, web servers, things like that.
So that's the bulk of what we see today. And there's going to be more of it as the AI applications come into
production. There are more specialized inference workloads and even training workloads in some situations that
rely on instrumenting GPUs. And for that, we have a new product out there that does GPU monitoring that we
announced at DASH. But all that I would call the infrastructure layer of AI.
Then on top of that, there's new problems in terms of understanding what the applications themselves are doing,
and the applications are largely non-deterministic anymore. They either are run by a model that is non-
deterministic by nature or they run in code that was not as carefully written as it used to be. It's not completely

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 07-Aug-2025
written by humans. It's largely written by AI agent. And as a result, you also need to spend a lot more time
understanding how that code is working and that largely happens in production.
So that's a brand-new area of observability, which is how do you deal with applications that have not been
completely defined in development and that have to be evaluated in production. And what we think is the whole
market is going there, not just the AI-natives. The AI-natives are definitely doing that today, both applications are
running on models and code that has been largely written by agents, but the rest of the market is going there. And
the best proof point you see of that is the very, very broad adoption today both of the API-gated AI models and of
the coding agents, which you see in every single large enterprise today.

Raimo Lenschow Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. And as to sales capacity, we have been successful in increasing both our number of salespeople and our
ramp sales capacity. We started that, as you said, in the last part of 2025. And we are seeing evidence of that
through our new logo production and our pipeline. We need to, as we talked about previously, go through the
ramping of that, but in looking at the size and productivity and performance, we see some good signs that that
quota capacity is becoming productive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raimo Lenschow Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
That's encouraging.
Operator. Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjit K. Singh Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thank you for taking the question, and congrats on the really stellar results this quarter. David, when I look at the
guide, I mean, this is probably one of the more impressive guides coming out of a Q2 that I've seen in a couple of
years. If I square that against the commentary that you guys made on the AI-native cohort that look, there could
be volatility from this cohort. When I kind of put those two together, the guidance is really strong. And so, when I
think about that potential risk, is it fair to assume that it's not something that you're seeing right now and may
come to play later on down the road? Because the guidance seems really strong. It doesn't seem to – at least on
the face, doesn't seem to anticipate that much volatility from the AI-native cohort.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. I think we gave metrics indicating that based on what we saw in the quarter, and we're seeing now that the
AI cohort continues to grow quite rapidly and we're winning a good market share in that. And so, how we
incorporate that into the guidance is, as we discussed previously, we know that there might be volatility in usage
or, as we negotiate contracts, in unit rates. And so, therefore, we adopt conservative assumptions as to that
performance in the remainder of the year. It's not something, as you can tell from the growth metrics, that we see
yet in our results, but as we learned in the previous cycle with cloud-natives, there can be volatility and we want to
make sure we incorporate that in our guidance.

Sanjit K. Singh Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Perfect. And then, Olivier, with the new security disclosures, congrats on crossing the $100 million threshold. Is
there any sort of change in the buying behavior? There's been consolidation in the industry. You guys have been
advancing your portfolio quite significantly. You guys have fully autonomous security agents. What's your
prospect for this pool of the business or this part of the business to drive growth for the balance of the year and
going into 2026?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. So, we have a very good product set. I mean, we mentioned we have three different products in there.
There are couple of those products that are really, I would say, reaching an inflection point in terms of what
they're doing on the customer side. When I think of where we're successful today in security, we're very
successful at getting broad adoption, like a large number of customers – a few customers that are spending $1
million-plus on security with us. So we're good with the – we're very happy with the proof points we have there.
What we haven't done very well yet is getting standardized adoption, wall-to-wall, in large enterprises, and that's
the next focus for us on the security side. And some of that is product work, but a lot of it is few customizations to
go-to-market there so we get better at selling enterprise-wide security top-down, which is not something we have
done a lot of in the past. So,. that's sort of where we are as a product.
So, happy with where we are. A lot of groundwork has been done on the product side, but there's quite a bit more
work to be done and a ton more opportunity in front of us. So, we are – that's why we're focusing on it.

Sanjit K. Singh Q

Appreciate the thoughts, Olivier. Thank you.
Operator. Thank you. And our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Martino Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey. Thanks for taking my question. This is Matt Martino on for Kash Rangan. David, you called out enterprise
consumption volatility last quarter. It sounds like that may have been consistent this time around, while SMB
continues to improve. So, could you perhaps characterize any discernible trends between these two customer
demographics? What went right relative to your expectations heading into 2Q? And really how that informs your
second half guide? Thanks a lot. That's it for me.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. I think, broadly, we're calling out that the usage trends across the segments were roughly consistent with
the previous quarters. We said we did see some more concentrated – this is not a comment about AI. This is a
comment about enterprise – less consumption relative to a spike, but we saw that stabilize. And we've seen small,
but gradual improvement of the SMB as a result of their usage of our products.

Matthew Martino Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Thanks.
Operator. Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark R. Murphy Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Thank you. I'll add my congrats. So, Olivier, I actually wanted to ask you about Toto and BOOM, those
announcements. It looks like you're bringing very serious AI research to a space where it is applicable, and
opening it up very broadly. The size of the dataset is vast. I'm curious what type of response do you expect to see
here. And just help us understand maybe how that can sustain growth in future years. And then I have a quick
follow-up for David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
I mean, look, we think there's so much opportunity in automation with autonomous AI agents. Like, we really
broke it out in three different categories so far. One is the SRE and responding to alerts and investigating alerts,
and maybe auto-remediating those issues. Second one is coding, fixing issues that we find in the code that
happen in production and verifying the fixes ourselves. And the last one is security, investigating security signals
on our own so that customers don't have to do that themselves.
There's so much I missed and that can happen there. A lot of it is going to depend on great research, which is
why we built a research team and which is why we developed and released with open-weight research models
already. Of course, the next step after releasing these research models is to incorporate them into the product. So
that's also one of the things we're working on right now. But there's just so much opportunity in front of us there
that we are – at this point, we are happy we got a great start.
We got fantastic result. I mean, our first release, as a research output, is really like a state-of-the-art model that
beats every single other model in a category that has seen quite a bit of action over the years. Time series
forecasting is a – has very wide applicability in a lot of different domains. So I think we – it shows that we can
perform at the highest level there. And I think it's a great sign of things to come in terms of AI automation and AI
agent.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark R. Murphy Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you. And then, David, we keep pointing out that Datadog is one of the only software companies
that's investing seriously in head count growth and it feels like that is paying top line dividends pretty
tremendously today. We noticed that your R&D spending is up noticeably in Q2. Just wondering what are the
mechanics that are driving that on the R&D line? And then the flip side is, what's allowing you to guide operating
income so much higher in Q3 than you had guided that for Q2?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. In R&D, as we talked about, we had an aggressive investment plan and we've been able to execute. And I
think our recruitment, credit to our recruitment team, we've been able to get people in the door, the right people

earlier in the year. There are some things within that around FX that weigh a little bit on it because, as you know,
we do have a significant R&D center in Paris, but I think the overall trend is the execution and recruiting.
We talked about some of the factors in Q2 that caused the operating income to increase – greater to increase at a
rate of 36%. And some of those are things like the timing of DASH. We talked about $13 million, the FX. And I
think that we have good line of sight on the drivers in R&D, both in terms of as we talked about and some of the
operating expenses are – have some seasonality in it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
The one thing I would add, which is that we also are spending more on AI training and inference in R&D. If you
compare to past years in R&D, the output of that is things such as Toto or the next versions of it that we're training
right now and experiments we're running to train agents, run simulations to train agents and things like that. You
shouldn't expect the overall picture of our R&D investment to change in the future, although I think we expect the
same envelope to be what we use moving forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. I'll add that, and really call out to our R&D team and our FinOps, that we said last quarter that we were
going to focus on how we use cloud. That applies to both the gross margin. And as you know, we dog-food. We
use a lot of our applications internally. And we were quite successful in Q2, in that run rate, we expect to continue
forward in optimizing our cloud usage, which is – will have an effect on the margins and the OpEx growth rates as
we proceed through the year.

Mark R. Murphy Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you very much.
Operator. Thank you. And our next question comes from Koji Ikeda of Bank of America. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Koji Ikeda Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. We all see that the second quarter was really, really
strong. Guidance for 2025 looks really, really great. And so I wanted to ask you about contract visibility. How are
you feeling about contract visibility, specifically with your large AI-native customers? I have to imagine you're very
close to these customers and having lots of conversations with them. And so I know there is some concern about
there. And David, you mentioned potential volatility. So I really want to ask about how you're feeling about
contract visibility. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
I mean, look, we can't really speak about any specific customers. As a reminder, any individual customer can do
whatever they want. They are the heroes of their own stories and we can't really speak for them.
I would say we have strong product engagement from our top customers, in general. We are working on making it
– making Datadog the very best platform for every company at any scale, including scale that has never been
seen before in companies with high growth. And I would say that's about it.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 07-Aug-2025
When you look at the way we forecast the business, remember that we have overall actually extremely high
retention product. For most customers, it's not rational to do it themselves, build their own solutions. We have
many customers who did turn to build themselves, who come back afterwards, and we named one on the call
today.
So we feel confident about the way we forecast the business and the mid- to long term there. Yeah. Of course, as
we renegotiate with customers, as they increase volume, et cetera, et cetera, what typically happens is we see
short-term drops and long-term growth in the revenue that's associated with them. And that's the way we've
always deployed it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Koji Ikeda Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Thanks so much. And I did have a follow-up on security. And so it sounds – I mean, great to hear about the
milestones, $100 million, growing 40%. And so thinking about the product set, how are you thinking about
expanding the capabilities from here? Are you focused on more organic, inorganic? And maybe an update to your
M&A philosophy. I mean, I guess the question here is, are you willing to go much bigger to supplement your
security strategy? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Look, we're looking at a number of different things in security that there's a lot of companies out there. There's a
lot of product areas we cover already and a lot of product – more product areas we can cover. It's also a space
where you need to cover a lot of the, we call them, boring must-have table stakes features on one end, but also
there's quite a bit of investment in the future with the way the whole field is being disrupted with AI.
So there's quite a bit of work to be done there. You should expect us to do more M&A around that, as we do in the
rest of the business, as there is a lot of assets out there and there's a lot of opportunities to grow.

Koji Ikeda Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Thank you so much.
Operator. Thank you. And our next question comes from Karl Keirstead of UBS. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Karl E. Keirstead Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks. Maybe I'll direct this to David and link the AI-native exposure to margins. So, David, now
that the AI-natives are 11% of Datadog's revenue mix, I think it's fair to ask whether the revenues from that cohort
are coming at similar margins as the rest of the business. Or do you think that this could be, even short term, a
modest source of margin pressure? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah, I would say, like we talked about last quarter, this isn't about the AI and margins, the AI cohort versus non-
AI cohorts. We price based on volume and on term. So to the extent you would have an AI customer who's doing
much the same things as our other customers in the use of the product, has similar volumes and similar terms to

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 07-Aug-2025
the non-AI, it would be similar margins. To the extent that we have a larger customer in there, given our price
grids, that customer would get a better discount. That's the way we've always priced. So it really is related to
customer size rather than AI-native or non-AI-native.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Karl E. Keirstead Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
And I will double up this with a bit of an infomercial. So we did see, as we mentioned last quarter, we were seeing
gross margins going down a little bit further than we would like them to. So what happened is we tasked our
engineering teams with optimizing the cloud usage, which goes across all of our customer base. What we did is
we turned to our own product, we turned to our cloud cost management product and our profiling product largely.
And then we – in a matter of months, we really turn up like substantial improvements, savings on our bills and
improvements in performance and efficiency of our systems, while we were still shipping new features. And that's
something that we're working right now to bring to all of our customers so they can get the same effect and they
can see their margins go up as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Karl E. Keirstead Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And maybe the natural follow-up there is, David, you mentioned that you're optimistic about gross margins
in the second half. Is that because of what Olivier just mentioned or are there some other drivers you have in
mind?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
No, it's because of what Olivier mentioned. So we said we were engaging in these efforts. And as we were more
successful in the quarter, we will be carrying that run rate forward, which wasn't fully in Q2 as well as using – what
Olivier mentioned, using cloud cost management and our projects to have further opportunities going forward. So
it's really about our progress and pace, which has been successful in our cloud efficiency going forward.

Karl E. Keirstead Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you, both.
Operator. Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Cikos from Needham. Your line is open.

Mike Cikos Q
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to double back on the enterprise segment, and just
– this is for Oli. But if I'm thinking about it, I know that we have the enterprise demonstrating this stable growth. Is
it fair to assume – like, is the analogy for enterprises who are more traditionally using CPU versus the AI-native
companies are growing investment in GPUs? Is it analogous to like 15 years ago where we saw, hey, on-prem
continues to see investment, but maybe more dollars are going towards cloud? Is that like a fair analogy when we
think about what sort of behavior is exhibited by these different customers and where Datadog is headed?

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 07-Aug-2025
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
I don't know if you can say it exactly this way, because at the time the on-prem versus cloud is tended to be
different customers, whereas today – sorry, is tended to be the same customers, whereas today like the AI-
natives and the enterprise are different companies altogether.
I think the main difference is the AI-natives have businesses that are growing very, very fast and infrastructure
that are growing very, very fast themselves, whereas the enterprises are still going through a controlled migration
from on-prem into the cloud, and the rate there is more limited by their bandwidth to undergo that migration as
opposed to being driven by an explosion of traffic on the demand side for them.
If I look at our enterprise segment in general, we see great trends in terms of the bookings, in terms of new
products attached, new customers, things that are – these customers are buying from us that are net new, but we
see that the usage growth is a bit more moderated – moderate than that at this point. And I think that speaks to
the bandwidth on their end just to move the workloads and to go fast there. And that relates, in part, to the fact
that a lot of our attention is spent on figuring out what AI technologies they're going to adopt and how they're
going to ship these AI applications into production.
Overall, we see that rate as stable. So, we think this is healthy, but we think this is – we think we will see more
growth from these enterprise customers as they actually get into production with the AI applications in the future.

Mike Cikos Q
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC
Understood. Thank you for that. And congrats on the security. I didn't want to leave hanging that. I don't know if
we got commentary on it, but could we please get an update on Flex Logs? I know it was a shining star, if I go
back a quarter ago. But just wanted to see how progress is tracking on the Flex Log side of the house.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. All of the big deals with enterprise customers now involve Flex Logs in some form. And that's a story that
resonates very well when we – especially when we have customers that want to migrate from legacy solutions
from logs. So, there's a number of things that we're working on with them, in particular making sure the migration
is painless for them, that there's a number of things that we are investing in on that side. But Flex Log is a big
draw for them as it really changes the picture economically and the predictability of the observability cost for them,
which is a major concern for data intensive plus observability such as logs.

Great. Thank you, guys.

Jake Roberge Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Yeah. Thanks for taking questions. There's, obviously, been a lot of talk about AI-natives around the business. I
know you've talked about the potential for optimization for several quarters, but we continue to see really strong
growth in that segment. So, if you were to see optimization, when would you expect that to happen? And as you

get a wider swath of customers in that AI-native cohort, do you think you're at the place where you could actually
digest an optimization by one or two of those customers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Well, I mean, look, if I knew when it was going to happen, I would tell you. The nature of our customers is, they
grow, they have their own businesses to run. They have their own constraints. We're here to help them deliver
their services. And that's what we work on every single day.
Now, every now and then, there's a renegotiation, a renewal, on occasions for customers to figure out what they
need to optimize and what they need to do for the future, but we never know whether it's going to happen this
quarter, next quarter, in three quarters, next year, or never. That's really hard to tell.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jake Roberge Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then could you also talk about the uptake and feedback that you're getting for your own
AI solutions, like Bits AI, the new observability agents? And when do you think those could really start layering
into the model?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. So, look, the initial response to the AI agents is really pretty positive. So, the AI SRE actually works
surprisingly well. I mean, if you think of how far technology has grown in a number of – a couple of years. And so
right now, we're busy basically shipping it to as many customers as we can and enabling the customers with it.
And that's a big area of focus in the business as well.
Like, it was developed by a fairly small team, the actual product that we ship. And now, we're busy scaling that up
as fast as we can so we can serve all those customers. That's the core focus of the business today. So, the initial
response is very positive. We've had customers purchase [indiscernible] (00:52:02) pretty quickly in their trial. And
so we feel very good about it.

Brent Thill Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Good morning. David, just on the quota-carrying rep capacity, I know you've been investing aggressively ahead of
the curve. But when you think about 2025, are you accelerating that count based on the great results you've
seen? Are you digesting that count given those reps are on board? Just give us a sense and flavor of what that
rep – quota rep count looks like through the rest of the year? And if you can shape the year, how that looks
versus 2024.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 07-Aug-2025
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. What we're doing is we're executing the plan we entered the year with. We knew – I think we said that we
had underinvested in go-to-market and looked at that with the white space, et cetera, and I would say we're
successfully executing that. The plan was a little more front-weighted, given our appetite for taking advantage of
that opportunity, but we're executing that. And we will look at the – towards the end of the year, as we plan for
next year, on the metrics around that and try to calibrate how we look at that growth next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brent Thill Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And Olivier, I'm just curious, many CEOs are either holding head count flat or down. We've seen Meta head
count down from two years ago, Microsoft head count flat. Others, Palantir is saying they're going to shrink head
count in 10x revenue. Do you believe you can become more efficient with fewer? Or do you think that that model
doesn't apply that you're seeing with other software companies?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
I mean, look, definitely the spend is shifting a little bit on the engineering side. As I said, we compute – we
consume more AI training, AI inference. And so that's definitely changing a bit of the balance between what you
have humans do and what you offload to GPUs.
That being said, we're still completely constrained by the amount of product we can put out there. There's a ton of
opportunity in every single direction we look, whether that's on the AI automation, whether it's on the security side,
whether that's in the new areas such as data observability or experimentation that we're going after. And so for
us, there's good – there's very strong ROI in the adds that we're making at the moment.

Andrew DeGasperi Q
Analyst, BNP Paribas Securities Corp.
Thanks for taking my question. First, on the ramp up in terms of sales capacity, would you say that's been broad-
based in terms of the productivity across both international and domestic?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
As we talked about previously, we have a less developed international footprint. And so our growth rate
internationally is running higher. We have markets we've talked about before, like Brazil and India and parts of
APJ and Middle East that we have opportunities to grow our footprint. So we are executing in that way.
We're doing a bottoms-up as always. We're looking at the accounts. We're looking at the TAM and we're looking
at how much we're covering it. So that produces a result of a little more investment intensity internationally versus
in North America, but there are lots of opportunities in North America as well.

Andrew DeGasperi Q
Analyst, BNP Paribas Securities Corp.
Thanks. That's helpful. And then on the enterprise side, I mean, given some of these reps are obviously on the
ground, should we expect the number of the attach rates in terms of the three or four more products per customer
sort of accelerate at this level? I know they've been ticking up about 1 point every quarter. Just wondering if that's
something we should be seeing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Well, I think, broadly, we expect the trends that we've seen of landing with some of the core products in the pillars
and then expanding to continue. As the platform has expanded, we've tended to land with more products, but
those trends that we evidenced in the script we expect to continue in the geographies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
And keep in mind, a lot of the – so when you're in the field, it's always easy to upsell a customer than to land a
new customer. And a lot of the work we're doing in territory management and in co-planning for the sales team is
really to make sure that there's enough of an incentive to go and look for new customers, so we keep driving a
number of new customers up as well. So there's this balance always between do you direct the sales force at
upselling existing customers or landing new customers.

Patrick Colville Q
Analyst, Scotiabank
All right. Thank you for squeezing me in. And I guess I just wanted to say before I ask my question. Congrats on
the S&P 500 Index inclusion. I mean, that's a really nice milestone for you guys. Look, the question we get
consistently from investors is on competition. I mean, you referred to your views on competition kind of
tangentially in other kind of answers. But maybe more specifically, I mean, what are you seeing competitively in
observability? And the one we get asked about a lot is versus Grafana and Chronosphere.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, look, there's always been competition in the field. As I like to say, when I first fundraised for
Datadog, the world that was coming back to me every single time with every single note that I was getting from
early VCs was crowded space. And so throughout the life of the company, there's been not only incumbents that
we mostly have beat in the market now, but also a steady stream of new entrants that we also have – year-after-
year, have beaten in the market. There's always new companies, always new folks that are building new things in
observability. I think it's very attractive for engineers to build that. I would know something about it.
Generally speaking, the competitive landscape hasn't changed much in the past 10 to 15 years. It's about the
same. The way we win and we will keep winning is by offering an integrated platform that solves as many

problems as possible for our customers, end-to-end. So we solve – we don't just focus on one tool of the puzzle.
We don't just focus on one data store, one specific brick that our customers might want to use. We solve the
whole problem for them end-to-end.
And then in the long run, we win by being more innovative, by having an economic model that lets us invest more
in R&D, develop more products, build our existing products into the future faster than anybody else can do and
cover more adjacencies faster than anybody else can do so we can have the broadest platform. So that's the
reason we win. And if you look at all of the companies you mentioned, none of them are in a position to do the
same. And so that's where we're going to end up in the end.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
And I think that's – I think we're at the end of the call. So that would be the last question. And just to close out, I
want to thank our customers for working with us to bring all of those great new products to market. So we had a
lot on our plate this year. You've seen that at DASH. It was amazing, by the way, to see all these customers and
meet with them at DASH and see the reception we get for all these new products. And so I want to thank them.
And I know we're working with many of them on how these products are going to be adopted and what's going to
happen in Q3 and Q4. So, again, thank you, and I will see you next quarter.
Operator. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.

Olivier Pomel
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Thanks, Yuka, and thank you all for joining us this morning.
We had a strong Q4 to end a very productive year. During 2024, we kept building and innovating, as we scaled up
our teams, and we went broader and deeper into the problems we saw for our customers from the cloud to AI. We
continued to add new customers and expand with existing ones, and we delivered more value as customers
adopted more products into Datadog platform.
Let me start with a review of our Q4 financial performance. Revenue was $738 million, an increase of 25% year-
over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended with about 30,000 customers, up from about
27,300 a year ago. We ended Q4 with about 3,610 customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more, up from about
3,190 a year ago. These customers generated about 88% of our ARR. We had 462 customers with ARR of $1
million or more compared to 396 a year ago, and we generated free cash flow of $241 million, with a free cash
flow margin of 33%.
Turning to platform adoption, our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. As of the end of Q4, 83%
of customers were using two or more products, which is about the same as last year. 50% of customers were
using four or more products, up from 47% a year ago. 26% of our customers were using six or more products, up
from 22% a year ago, and 12% of our customers were using eight or more products, up from 9% a year ago.
During 2024, we continued to land and expand with larger customers. As of December 2024, 45% of the Fortune
500 are Datadog customers, up from 42% in 2023. We think many of the largest enterprises are still very early in
their journey to the cloud. The median Datadog ARR for our Fortune 500 customers is still less than $0.5 million,
which leaves a very large opportunity for us to grow with these customers.
So we're serving more customers, with more products, and we're also very pleased to celebrate several
milestones for the business. First, our total ARR now exceeds $3 billion, a big achievement for all of us at
Datadog, even though we're still only just getting started. And we have achieved this milestone largely by growing
our first product, infrastructure monitoring, and expanding into the other pillars of observability, APM and log
management.
Today, infrastructure monitoring contributes over $1.25 billion in ARR. But we didn't stop there, as log
management is now over $750 million in ARR, and so is our third pillar, as our end-to-end APM products together
also exceed $750 million in ARR. Note that end-to-end APM includes all the Datadog products our customers use

to monitor their applications, which are core APMs, continuous profiler, database monitoring and error tracking, as
well as synthetics and regular user monitoring.
Now remember that even in these three pillars of observability, we're still just getting started, as more than half of
our customers do not buy all three pillars from us, or at least not yet. Meanwhile, we're making progress with our
other products, and we are pleased to see them increasing in customer usage and growth. Products outside the
three pillars now contribute over $200 million in ARR, and we are excited about our growth opportunities in the
many new products in this group.
Now let's discuss this quarter's business drivers. In Q4, we saw usage growth from existing customers that was
roughly similar to the year-over-quarter. Our usage growth during the quarter generally played out as expected,
including a stronger October and November, and the slowdown we typically see at the end of December. We
continue to experience a stable business environment, and our customers overall are growing their cloud usage,
while some are continuing to be cloud-conscious.
We also hit a new record in bookings this quarter, as our go-to-market teams executing our first-ever quarter with
over $1 billion in bookings. As a reminder, our bookings don't translate immediately into revenue growth, but it is
an indicator that we continue to serve our new and existing customers well, and they are growing with us over
time.
Finally, churn has remained low, with growth revenue retention stable in the mid-to-high 90s, highlighting the
mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers.
Moving on to R&D and what we built in 2024. We released over 400 new features and capabilities this year. Now
that's too much for us to cover today, but let's go over some of our innovations. First, we continue to improve the
Datadog platform. We now have more than 850 integrations, making it easy for our customers to bring in every
type of data they need, benefit from all the new AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI capabilities, and engage with the
latest technologies, like the newly emerging AI stack.
We announced Kubernetes autoscaling to help customers right size the Kubernetes environment without
impacting stability and performance. We launched Datadog monitoring for Oracle Cloud infrastructure, so
customers can now monitor their OCI stack and unify their monitoring across all clouds and on-prem
environments. And we took several big steps to expand on Datadog as the best observability platform for open
telemetry users, including making our infra monitoring and APM instrumentation, fully interoperable with OTel
components, and improving the experience for OTel customers by embedding the OTel Collector directly within
the Datadog agent.
In the next-gen AI and LLM space, we continue to add capabilities to Bits AI, launching Bits AI for incident
management and previewing Bits AI for autonomous investigations. We launched LLM observability and general
availability to help customers evaluate, safely deploy, and manage their models in production. And we continue to
see increased interest in next-gen AI. At the end of Q4, about 3,500 customers used one or more Datadog AI
integrations to send us data about their machine learning, AI, and LLM usage.
In the end-to-end APM space, our error tracking product now allows customers to view and manage errors across
user sessions, applications, and logs, all in one place. We kept building out data observability, including the
launch of data jobs monitoring, to help data engineers detect problematic Sparks and Databrick jobs anywhere in
their pipelines. And we expanded the technologies we can provide deep insights into, such as Amazon SQS in
data stream monitoring and MongoDB in database monitoring.

In digital experience, our customers can now use our mobile app testing to test iOS and Android applications on
real mobile phones. We allow faster investigation of mobile app issues with mobile session replay. And while
Product Analytics remained in early stages, we are encouraged by customer interest in using Datadog to analyze
user behavior for better business outcomes.
In log management, Flex Logs launched into general availability, and customers can now cost-effectively retain
and analyze massive volumes of data over long periods of time. We expanded Log Workspaces for advanced
analytics and querying, and we simplified the deployment of observability pipelines with new out-of-the-box
template and granular configuration options.
In cloud security, we now have more than 7,000 customers using one or more security products. We launched
Agentless Scanning to detect risks and vulnerabilities within hosts, containers, and serverless across a whole
cloud account in a few clicks. We shipped Datadog Infrastructure-as-Code Security, so our customers can identify
and fix misconfigurations in their Terraform and CloudFormation code. Our customers can now use Kubernetes
Security Posture Management to benchmark their environments against industry best practices.
We launched Code Security to detect vulnerabilities in first-party code running in production environment. We
continue to expand on our Software Composition Analysis capabilities and we built many more integrations,
content packs and investigative workflows into our Cloud SIEM product.
In software delivery, developers can now use Datadog Code Security with Quality Gates to ensure production
code meets quality, security and performance standards. And we announced the ability for customers to observe
DORA Metrics to improve the speed and efficiency of their engineering teams.
In cloud service management, we launched our modern scheduling solution, Datadog On-Call, for general
availability last month. We are already seeing significant customer interest for it and are excited to solve this
problem for our users.
We launched Event Management for general availability, using AIOps to intelligently aggregate, consolidate and
simplify alerts from any sources. We built out our Case Management functionality so users can triage, assign and
close production-related tickets faster. And finally, our App Builder product lets users build apps to implement
their own custom processes and workflows and take action directly within Datadog.
So, I'd like to thank our production engineering teams for a very productive 2024 and I'm super excited about what
we have planned for 2025.
Let's move on to sales and marketing. We had a strong close to 2024, with record bookings and some very
exciting new logos and expansions. Let's go through a few.
First, we landed a seven-figure annualized deal with a major US financial institution. This company was struggling
with high costs and expensive logging tools. By using Datadog Flex Logs and Observability Pipelines, this
customer expects to save money on log management and will redeploy those savings to invest in observability
transformation. This customer is starting with four Datadog products and is replacing four commercial and open
source tools.
Next, we landed a seven-figure annualized deal with a large Brazilian retail company. This company had built a
homegrown open-source based observability tool, but had poor visibility into customer journeys for their shopping

application. With Datadog, they quickly improved application performance, which drove higher App Store ratings,
better digital reputation and improved user confidence. This customer is starting with five Datadog products.
Next, we landed a six-figure annualized deal with a leading American entertainment company. This company had
limited visibility into their customers' experience on in-store kiosks and on their mobile app. By using Datadog's
unified platform, this company will correlate monitoring across front and back end and enable multiple teams to
collaborate for improved customer experience. This land deal featured our brand new Product Analytics
capabilities and will displace two commercial observability and analytics tools.
Next, we landed a high six-figure annualized deal with a US federal health insurance company. This company's
Medicare services business requires a SIEM, but its SIEM tool was expensive and poorly adopted by the teams.
They will now rely on both Flex Logs and our Cloud SIEM within GovCloud for significant cost savings, all that
while improving security and compliance. And we have the opportunity to provide additional value and expand to
three-pillar end-to-end observability over time.
Next, we signed a seven-figure annualized expansion with a Fortune 100 oil and gas company. This customer is
moving thousands of hosts from on-prem to the cloud and will replace two legacy infrastructure network
monitoring tools. The estimated cost and productivity savings from replacing these legacy tools exceeds $1
million annually. And we work with them to evaluate the productivity gains when thousands of users saw less
disruption by incidents for expected savings of over $10 million per year. This customer is expanding to use 14
Datadog products.
Last for today, we signed a seven-figure annualized expansion with a leading security software company. This
customer built a homegrown log management tool using open-source software, but it was time-consuming to
maintain, extremely costly and performed poorly with unacceptable delays. By moving to Flex Logs, this customer
is already saving on tool costs, reducing mean time-to-resolution and increasing user productivity, with estimated
savings of over $1 million a year. And this customer is expanding to use eight Datadog products.
And that's it for this quarter's highlights. Congrats again to our go-to-market teams for their great work in 2024,
our best ever close to the year and the exciting plans they've laid out for 2025.
Before I turn it over to David for a financial review, a few words on our longer-term outlook. We continue to
believe digital transformation and cloud migration are long-term secular growth drivers of our business as well as
critical for every company to deliver value and gain competitive advantage. And we think moving to modern cloud-
based technologies is more important than ever as more companies step up to adopt AI capabilities.
We continue to focus on delivering innovation and value to our customers against their mission-critical needs. And
more than ever, we feel ideally positioned to have customers of every size, in every industry to transform,
innovate and drive value through technology adoption.
And with that, I will turn it over to our CFO. David?

Thanks, Olivier. To start, Q4 revenue was $738 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 7% quarter-over-quarter.
To dive into some of the drivers of the Q4 revenue growth, overall, we saw trends for usage growth from existing
customers that were consistent with their expectations. We continued to see conditions that were similar to recent
quarters and roughly stable throughout 2024, with continued movement to cloud and modern DevOps

technologies and with customers remaining cost-conscious and seeking efficiency and value from their spend. In
Q4, we saw usage growth from existing customers that was roughly similar to the usage growth in the year-ago
quarter.
Next, we continued to see robust contribution from AI-native customers, who represented about 6% of Q4 ARR,
roughly the same as last quarter, and up from about 3% of ARR in the year-ago quarter. AI-native customers
contributed about 5 percentage points of year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 versus 4 points in the last quarter
and about 3 points in the year-ago quarter.
So, we saw strong growth from AI-native customers in Q4. We believe that adoption of AI will continue to benefit
Datadog in the long term. Meanwhile, we did see some optimization and volume discounts related to contract
renewals in Q4. We remain mindful that we may see volatility in our revenue growth on the backdrop of long-term
volume growth from this cohort, as customers renew with us on different terms and as they may choose to
optimize cloud and observability usage.
Next, as we look at usage growth by segment, similar to recent quarters, we are seeing the strongest year-over-
year usage growth from our enterprise customers. Meanwhile, our SMB customers' usage growth remained silent,
with slight year-over-year acceleration versus last quarter. As a reminder, we define enterprise as customers with
5,000 employees or more, mid-market as customers with 1,000 to 5,000 employees, and SMB as customers with
less than 1,000 employees.
Regarding our retention metrics, our trailing 12-month net revenue retention percentage was in the high-110s in
Q4 compared to the mid-110s last quarter. And finally, our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention percentage
remained stable in the mid-to-high 90s.
Regarding our customer growth, we added 800 net customers in Q4 for a total of around 30,000 customers. This
includes the highest number of gross new logos and dollar new logo annualized bookings since early 2023.
Now moving to our financial results. Billings were $908 million, up 26% year-over-year. Remaining performance
obligations, or RPO, was $2.27 billion, up 24% year-over-year. Current RPO growth was in the mid-20s percent
year-over-year. RPO duration was down year-over-year. Normalizing for duration, RPO growth was in the mid-
30s year-over-year. We continue to believe revenue is a better indication of our business trends than billings and
RPO, as those can fluctuate relative to revenue based on the timing of invoicing and the duration of customer
contracts.
Now let's review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP.
We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. First, gross profit in
the quarter was $603 million, or a gross margin of 81.7%. This compares to a gross margin of 81.1% last quarter
and 83.4% in the year-ago quarter.
Our Q4 OpEx grew 30% year-over-year, accelerating from 21% last quarter, as we continue to execute on our
hiring plans. This includes our successful investment in sales and marketing, which grew 31% year-over-year in
Q4 2024 to 23% of revenues, up from 5% year-over-year growth in Q4 of 2023 at 22% of revenues.
We ended 2024 with sales and marketing head count of about 3,000, up from about 2,400 at the end of 2023.
This also includes our successful investment in R&D, which grew 29% year-over-year in Q4 2024 to 29% of
revenues, up from 15% year-over-year growth in Q4 last year at 28% of revenues. We ended 2024 with R&D
head count of about 3,100, up from 2,400 at the end of 2023.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 13-Feb-2025
Q4 operating income was $179 million, or a 24% operating margin, compared to 25% last quarter and 28% in the
year-ago quarter.
Now, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $4.2 billion in cash, cash
equivalents, and marketable securities. In December, we issued a five-year, $1 billion convertible note. We used
$122 million of the proceeds for transaction costs and cap calls associated with these notes. Simultaneous with
the issuance of these notes, we repurchased 15% of our outstanding 2025 convertible notes and terminated the
associated cap calls for net costs of $142 million.
After taking into account this issuance and repurchasing activity, our cash balance increased by $736 million net.
$636 million principal amount of the 2025 convertible notes and associated cap calls remains outstanding, and we
expect to retire the outstanding amount of the 2025 notes on or before their maturity date of June 15, 2025.
Cash flow from operations was $265 million in the quarter. After taking into account capital expenditures and
capitalized software, free cash flow was $241 million, for a free cash flow margin of 33%.
And now for our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2025. First, our guidance philosophy remains
unchanged. As a reminder, we base our guidance on trends observed in recent months and apply conservatism
on these growth trends. So, for the first quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $737 million to $741
million, which represents 21% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range
of $162 million to $166 million, which implies an operating margin of 22%. And non-GAAP net income per share is
expected to be $0.41 to $0.43 per share, based on approximately 366 million weighted average diluted shares
outstanding.
And for the full fiscal year 2025, we expect revenues to be in the range of $3.175 billion to $3.195 billion, which
represents 18% to 19% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of
$655 million to $675 million, which implies an operating margin of 21%. And non-GAAP net income per share is
expected to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.70 per share, based on approximately 369 million weighted average
diluted shares outstanding.
Now, for some additional notes on this guidance. As it relates to our growth in OpEx and hiring, first, we
successfully executed on our hiring plans in 2024, ending the year with about 6,500 employees growing 27%
year-over-year. And we remain excited by our numerous long-term growth opportunities. Our operating profit
guidance reflects our intent to continue to invest for future growth in 2025. Because of that, our operating profit
guidance implies operating expense growth in the high 20s percent range year-over-year.
As we did in 2024, we expect to grow our investments in both sales and marketing and R&D this year. As I
discussed earlier, in Q4, sales and marketing expenses grew 31% year-over-year, and R&D expense grew 29%
year-over-year. We continue to expand our capabilities in sales and marketing, including expanding in our less
mature geographies, adding more channel and alliance capabilities, and extending our efforts around larger
enterprises, among many other initiatives. And in R&D, we are focused on delivering more value to our
customers, both in expanding the number of products for our customers and the capabilities we add as part of the
Datadog platform. Meanwhile, we continue to balance our investments in long-term growth with financial
discipline, as we have executed in the past.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 13-Feb-2025
Now turning to the other areas of the P&L, first, we expect net interest and other income for fiscal 2025 to be
approximately $120 million. Regarding taxes, our non-GAAP tax rate is 21% in fiscal year 2025, and this is
reflected in our non-GAAP net income per share guidance.
Next, we expect our cash taxes in 2025 to be about 1% of 2025 revenues, or about $30 to $35 million. While we
have utilized the majority of our US-based NOLs, we have R&D tax credits and deductions related to stock-based
compensation that reduced our cash tax payments. Finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized
software together to be in the 4% to 5% of revenues range in 2025.
Now, to summarize, we are pleased with our execution in 2024. We are well-positioned to help our existing and
prospective customers with their cloud migration and digital transformation journeys, and we continue to invest in
our growth opportunities in 2025. I want to thank all Datadogs worldwide for their efforts last year, and I'm very
excited about our plans for this year.
And with that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is
open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark R. Murphy Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Thank you so much. Great to see the record bookings in Q4. I'm curious how you're feeling overall about the book
of business for AI native customers. We recall you anticipated several months ago that some of them were
growing so rapidly that they would increase their commitments with better terms. And I'm curious if the
developments that you mentioned on the call aligned with that or whether any of that might become so large that
they would try to handle observability in health. Just in other words, I'm trying to understand if the AI usage and
commits are kind of on the same trajectory that they were on or whether you feel that there are some oscillations
there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Thanks for the question. So I think, in general, what happened during the quarter is pretty much what we thought
would happen when we discussed it in the last earnings call.
When you look at the AI cohort, we definitely saw some renewals with higher commits, better terms and
optimization in usage, all at the same time, which is fairly typical. What typically happens with larger-end
customers, in particular, is at the time of renewal, customers, when trying to optimize what they can, they're going
to get better prices of their commitments. And we might see a flat or down month or quarter after that with a still
sharp growth from the year before and growth to come in the year to come. So that's what we typically see.
When you look at the cohort as a whole, even with that significant renewal, optimization and better unit
economics, this cohort as a whole is stable quarter to quarter in its revenue and it's growing a lot from the quarter
before, even with all that.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 13-Feb-2025
Now, when you talk about, like, some very large customers that are growing extremely fast, perhaps the fastest
we've seen in the tech industry, there is always customers that want to in-house their observability or monitoring.
Typically, what we see is it's more of a cultural choice, because it's not economically rational unless you have a
combination of tremendous scale, exceptional access to talent and you also don't have a growth that is limited by
the engineering bandwidth you have for innovation work that is core to your business. And so, all three are
typically never true at the same time.
If you look at the top 5, 10 companies in the world by infrastructure size today, some don't run any third-party
software and build everything themselves. Some do run third-party software and do run on service, usually on
part of their businesses. But really, at the end of the day, like, those 5, 10 companies are not the market for selling
software or SaaS and they never have been. So, the rest of the world is the core market.
And when we talk about the AI cohort, what's interesting is not so much this relatively small set of AI-native
companies. And we see them more as a sign of things to come in terms of a broader AI adoption. So, what's
interesting to us is how the rest of the world starts operating AI workloads and grows into that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark R. Murphy Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Okay. Understood. And then, just as a very quick follow-up, Olivier, either for Olivier or David. All three major
hyperscalers did miss their Q4 revenue forecast. And they were talking about capacity constraints on the AI side.
But the non-AI side for some of them seem to slow, just the regular typical cloud migrations. I'm just wondering if
you felt the timing of the holidays had any impact on December or whether their AI capacity constraints might be
flowing through to Datadog as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. It's hard to tell exactly what's going on with the AI capacity constraint and things like that. If I were just to
compare and contrast what we do with our core growth with the cloud providers, overall, we're growing a bit faster
than the cloud providers, including the very big bump they're getting from selling GPUs, which is not something
we monetize very well on our end, in part because those GPUs are largely attached to trading workloads that we
don't play a big roll in, but also in part because these are sort of new pieces of infrastructure that will have
different needs as they become more broadly used by larger number of companies.
If you back out, as you mentioned, the GPU-related, AI-related part of the growth for the cloud providers, they are
slowing down and we are meaningfully outgrowing them that part of the business. And I think that if you zoom up,
that's sort of in line with the broader trend of – we're driven by – our business is driven by [ph] digital (00:35:23)
information and cloud transformation, which is happening, which will keep happening and we're outgrowing that
trend now and in the long run.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark R. Murphy Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Thank you very much. Really appreciate it.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 13-Feb-2025
Yeah. Thank you for taking the question and congrats on the record bookings quarter in Q4. Olivier, I want to talk
on the sales and marketing side, how you're thinking about this year in terms of the magnitude of change versus
the prior year, whether it's relating to the investments in underserved geos, with the channel partners or
continuing to serve the enterprise opportunity? What do you have in store for the sales organization going into
2025?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
So, we have quite a bit in store. There's a number of parts of the business we're being a little bit more deliberate
about pushing the product, in particular, in the segment where we think we're on the cusp of acceleration in critical
mass and we can invest and [ph] push (00:36:29) behind that. So, there's a few examples.
Like, we mentioned, for example, in the some of the customer wins we discussed today, we mentioned a number
of wins for Flex Logs. And we definitely see the potential for logs and Flex Logs in particular to get much more
adoption in the market. We also see a very interesting and timely competitive opening there with some of the
bigger players being taken out recently. So, there's efforts like that, that we're pushing into.
Another example we gave on the call or the product that's exciting to us right now is On-Call. On-Call is brand-
new, just entered here, but demand is very, very strong. So, we are making sure that we have the right programs
from a go-to-market perspective to make sure those products can take off as they should.
So, if you zoom out from the specific product-related programs or the specific partner-related or segment-related,
because there's a number of those, what we're doing really that matters is we are growing the sales capacity.
We've been growing the sales capacity last year. I would say we probably got a bit of a slower start last year in
the first half of the year at growing the sales capacity than we would have wanted.
We accelerated that throughout the second half of the year. We're still accelerating the sales capacity growth and
we expect to see the results from that. The rule of thumb is when you invest in sales, when you hire sales and
marketing, you start seeing the impact in one to two years after that. When you hire engineering and you build the
R&D capacity, you start seeing the impact in two to three years after that. So, we're pushing towards that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjit K. Singh Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
That makes total sense. And just as a follow-up, actually, I was going to ask about logs and Flex Log. It sort of
dominated lot of your customer highlights this quarter. In terms of like logs becoming a sort of renewed focus
across the sort of observability stack, you, obviously, have some incumbents. But is there anything sort of
changing technologically? You guys have, obviously, I think, re-architected your log platform. But what seems to
be driving the renewed interest in log and Cloud SIEM that gets you excited about the opportunity?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Well, it's a combination of – there's definitely new interesting technologies and economics that relate to these
technologies that resonate well with customers. So, now, you can keep a lot more data and keep it for a lot
longer, and it's a lot more cost efficient. And so that's definitely one aspect.
Second aspect is modernizing the stack with something that's really cloud-first, cloud-based, which was not the
case of the platforms that were mostly used before that. And then there is interesting opportunities to also unify

some of the operational aspects and the security aspects. So we, alongside with Flex Logs, we also see quite a
bit of demand for Cloud SIEM, and we think the condition of those is very interesting. So I would say all those
together would drive the renewed specific interest in that part of the business in logs and why we're pushing this.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raimo Lenschow Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Perfect. Thank you. Quick, like, there's a lot of focus on the big AI guys at the moment. But how do you – I mean
but that's only the starting point for the AI opportunity. Can you see like what you see in first feedback on people
looking at inference workloads and trying to have observability on them because I would assume in the long run,
that's probably the big opportunity, what do you see there? And then I have a follow-up for David.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yes. So on the inference side, mostly still what customers do is they use a third-party model, either through an
API or through a third-party inference platform. And what they're interested in is measuring whether that model is
doing the right thing. And that's what we serve right now with added observability, for example. That's where we
see quite a bit of adoption that does not come largely from the AI-native companies. So that's what we see today.
In terms of operating the inference stack fully and we see relatively few customers with that yet, we think that's
something that's going to come next. And by the way, we're very excited by the developments we see in the field.
So it looks like there's many, many different options that are going to be viable for running your AI inference.
There's a very healthy set of commercial API-gated services.
There's models that you can install in the open source. There are models in the open source today that are
providing quality with the best closed API models. So we think the ecosystem is developing into a rich, diverse
ecosystem that will allow customers to have a diversity of modalities for using AI, which is exciting.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raimo Lenschow Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Yes, that's really exciting. And then, David, like if you think about the increased investments that we're
seeing across sales and marketing and R&D, obviously, we could have kind of taken kind of an accelerated
approach or an approach there like this time last year, the year before, et cetera. What drives your confidence or
what drives the decision to kind of think this year? Like what are the signals that you're seeing out there to kind of
get you excited about that? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Yes. Good. It's really bottoms up. We look at the geographies in one case where we see the white space and the
evidence of success and attainment. And the accounts that, as we talked about internationally, we don't fully
cover. Next, as you know, we've been developing our channel and our partnerships. We think there's a big

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 13-Feb-2025
opportunity there. So we've been increasing our investment and see return on that, the percentage of our sales
that are affected by channel partners has been increasing, so there is evidence there.
And then in terms of across the different types of customers, we see very large enterprise customers that need to
be treated in a certain way and have been increasing the way we go to market. Of course, we go bottoms up, but
we also have an increasing effort in some key accounts. So all of those things are based on the evidence of the
demand cycles we see in our results to date.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
One thing to keep in mind when we look at – because I know something that's in the back of the mind of many of
our listeners here. When we look at growing the sales capacity and the relationship between that and how we
think we're going to grow the business and guidance for this year and things like that in particular, remember that
the revenue comes from usage and usage is only loosely related in time to the bookings we get from the sales
team.
And so when we think about the guidance we're putting forward and what we're looking at for the year, it's all
based on usage, recent usage trends that we discounted to the future. And it doesn't really incorporate a lot of the
longer term gains we get from the scaling of the go-to-market.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Just adding one more thing. I think we said that in 2023, with the risks that we saw in the market that we did take
a prudent approach and we slowed down the growth of the go-to-market. So there is some of catch-up.
Essentially, these are things that we pull back on a little bit, took a little more conservative approach. And once we
saw the evidence in some of these territories, we began to accelerate. And if you look at the sales and marketing
investment in the second half of the year, you'll see that we started to be successful in increasing our quota
capacity and our go-to-market investments.

Hi, thank you, very much. I'm wondering if I could get your assessment of the disparity between the strong
forward-looking indicators, so that's RPO, CRPO, forward-looking bent of the business versus the conservative
guidance. Any thoughts on that? Is it a bit more conservative given that your forward-looking indicators actually
look a little bit stronger than one would have expected.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 13-Feb-2025
And second, maybe this is one for you, David. Is there – at the margin, any change at all with respect to the
usage upside versus the commitment that customers are making and therefore, that could help understand why
the guidance is what it is? Thank you so much once again.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
So I think on the first question, really that's what I was just commenting on, which is that the revenue report is
based on usage, and we only want to get the usage from customers. And it's not directly linked in time to the
bookings. In many cases, the bookings come ahead of the revenues with a new customer, and it's going to take
them time to ramp into their commitment. In some cases, the bookings can trail the revenues, okay.
Say, customers grew a lot, and they had a lot of already uncommitted revenue, and then they will commit to some
or part of that over time. So there's less of a direct relationship there. Again, when we look at guidance...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kash Rangan Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Probably I get that, I think you explained it. But at the margin, how do you convert those commitments into usage?
I mean are there things that you're emphasizing in the organization to get better conversion in a shorter span of
time? That was really the heart of the question, if I'm not clear. Sorry about that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yes, there's a number of things we're doing for that, right? I mean part of it is the usual question of how much of
your comp plan on the sale side should be usage versus bookings. And we're definitely experimenting with some
different ratios there, and we try to optimize for the best outcomes.
But in general, again, just if I go back to the biggest question, which is what's the relationship between what we
see there and the guidance. Guidance is really based on the recent trends, and we extrapolate them, with some
discount. So by definition, even though we see acceleration in some of the drivers, we ourselves invest more in
some areas, it's unlikely that we – unless we see direct acceleration in the recent quarter that you will see
accelerating number of the guidance there. Just because of the way this is constructed, like we're very disciplined
in terms of sticking to the usage trends there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Yes. Just to add. I think we've said that in some quarters, the bookings and RPO numbers might diverge from the
ARR and revenue growth. I think in this quarter, you see there's pretty good convergence, right? They all point to
the same range, et cetera. We certainly have the motion, as you mentioned, of assigning commits and then
working with clients to use those commits and then go above that. That hasn't changed.
So the amount of spread between usage and commits is similar to what it's been. I think you're correct. A lot of
what we do operationally and our customer success, our technical account management, our product
management, our marketing is about trying to get our customers to use more of the platform. And in the metrics
we show, both in terms of revenues of the different product areas and in the cross-sell metrics that continues to
be strong.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 13-Feb-2025
I echo what Oli said was when we provide the guidance, we really haven't changed our methodology. We take
what we know from those trends and we've essentially put conservatism going forward. So I think you can't
necessarily go one to one there, and we've not changed our approach in doing that and providing guidance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Hedberg Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Thanks for taking my question. David, for you, it was nice to see NRR tick up a bit. And I realize it's trailing
12 metric and this year was met with a lot of stability here. I'm just sort of curious, when you think about that going
forward, what have you embedded from a retention perspective in your 2025 outlook? And then maybe to put a
finer point on the AI native question earlier. Does your full-year guidance assume that we see a pretty stable
contribution there throughout the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Yes. So on the first question, yes, it has been ticking up. And then what we do essentially, there's really two inputs
into revenue guidance. One is – and the largest one is what is net retention and the other is what contribution
from new. And we essentially, as you know, and you can probably figure that out, we do take the net retention
and then discount that. So that's what we look at.
In terms of the AI contribution, I think we try to embed that in the level of the discount. I think we essentially don't
assume that there's going to be some non-pro rata acceleration of AI.
There may be to big opportunity, but we don't assume that. So we try to take the conservatism that we have in our
net retention or expansion rate and apply that across the customer base, not being smart enough to know exactly
where it might be or not be.

Hey guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I appreciate all the disclosure on ARR coming from the 3 core
pillars here on infrastructure monitoring, APM and logs. And so as we move into 2025 and beyond, how do you
think about the potential for infrastructure monitoring specifically, the growth there to accelerate from current
levels and what would be the trigger for that?

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 13-Feb-2025
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Good question. I think first, there's a number of new use cases that are emerging that are related to infrastructure
that we might want to cover. Again, once they're emerging, they're actually emerging, like we still have to see
what the actual need is from large number of customers. I'm talking in particular about infrastructure concerns
around GPU management, GPU optimization. Like, there's quite a lot going on there that we can potentially do.
But for that, we need to see broad usage of raw GPUs by large number of customers as opposed to usage by a
smaller number of AI-native customers, which is mostly what we still see today there.
There are some interesting pockets of the market that we don't get into today, because there are still some large
IoT fleets or on-prem fleets, so things that are part of our customers set up that we were not built from day one to
handle, but that are now becoming part of the picture as those customers settle in some form of mix of what they
have on the cloud and what they keep on-prem. And so, we see some opportunity there, too. So, there's a
number of areas where we can progress on the infrastructure side.
Another area is network monitoring, which we've been building up. So, there's a few things there. But we definitely
still see quite a bit of opportunity.
The largest opportunity, of course, is that – look, even for infrastructure monitoring, where we're clearly the leader,
we still have a relatively small part of the market that is growing in the cloud. And so, a lot of our efforts have to do
with making sure that, one, we land enough of the right customers. Now, again, we still have a bit less than half of
the Fortune 500 as customers today. And then, for those customers, we get into all of their workloads, all of their
environments and we keep going up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Koji Ikeda Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. Thank you. And just a follow-up here on FX and the impacts to revenue and guidance. And so, I know the
vast majority of contracts are in USD. But with 30% of revenue being international, are you considering some
changes in pricing and packaging, making pricing more localized for international customers? And then, also
trying to understand any benefits to operating margin from FX in 2024 and how that may be accounted for in the
2025 guide? Thank you so much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Obstler A
Chief Financial Officer, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. As you know, we are largely a US dollar-based company. Our exposure is not very high. We do
occasionally look at local billing. It's not something that is significant. I think that's all wrapped up into our offers to
our clients. And I think unlike other companies that have been reporting, FX is not a very major effect on our
financial results.

Eric Heath Q
Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Hey. Thanks for taking my question here. Oli, you talked about Flex Logs having a lot of success, some M&A in
the marketplace that's opened up some opportunity. But just curious from displacement activity that you're seeing
with of the recent M&A takeout on the SIEM and log management vendors and curious also what your ability is to

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 13-Feb-2025
win both the logs and security use cases, because in our feedback, talking to customers and channel, it sounds
like it's oftentimes one or the other, but not both. So, I'm curious of your ability to win both those workloads.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. So, what happens is, so first of all, we see a lot of success with some of the migrations, in particular, to
Flex Logs. The majority of the use cases are around DevOps as opposed to a SIEM to start, but we do see a
number of opportunities that come solely from SIEM to start with.
You're right that they typically don't come together, because the two are typically purchased by different parts of
the org and maybe they come up at different times or maybe the motivations come from different parts of the org
to bring there a change.
So, what we've seen is that in the growing number of migration to Flex Logs we've seen, we typically start with a
few workloads in Flex Logs and ops. And then after that, we see more workloads in ops open and some
conversations on the SIEM side.
I would say, historically, the SIEM side has been harder to convert, because it is more heavily entrenched with a
lot of specific queries and workflows that are built on top of legacy products. But we've developed a lot
functionality to not only come to parity with all the functionality that's being used for those custom bits, but also to
help customers directly migrate that. And that's part of the efforts that are coming to bear this year in terms of
being able to accelerate in the go-to-market with those products.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric Heath Q
Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Awesome. And, Oli, I'd love to just get some of your thoughts on Agentic AI and AI generally. Just curious, when
we think about agents, which parts of the core observability platform that you think are most relevant or going to
be most beneficial to your business as you start to monitor those?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Yeah. Well, first of all, it's a bit hard to tell, because it's a very nascent field. So, my guess is, in a year, it will
probably look different from what it looks like today. Just like this year, it can look very different from what it
looked like last year. What we do see, though, is that – so, when we built – we started building our LLM
observability product, most of the use cases we saw there from customers were chatbot in nature or RAG in
nature, trying to access information and return the information.
Now, we see more and more customers building agents on top of that and sending us the data from their agents.
So, we definitely see a growing trend there of adoption and the LLM observability product is a good level of
abstraction at least for the current iteration of these agents to look at them. So, that's what we can see today.
In our internal developments, obviously, we use our own products heavily for that. And we see a lot of different
opportunities to automate work with agents on top of our platform. I would say, though, that we also do see new
modalities, different modalities for developing those agents. And the market is changing very, very quickly here.

open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick Walravens Q
Analyst, Citizens JMP Securities
Great. Thank you so much. So, Oli, I think you started touching on this, but you guys help your customers to
digitally transform. But when you look inside of Datadog, what are some of the processes and the areas where
you see the possibility to really drive some improvements?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Inside Datadog?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick Walravens Q
Analyst, Citizens JMP Securities
Yeah, inside Datadog.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Well, everywhere. Like what's fascinating about the current evolution of AI, in particular, is that it touches a lot of
the different areas of the business. The first area for a company like overs, like the first area to be transformed is
really the way software is being built. What engineers use, how they write software, how they debug software,
how they also operate their systems. And part of that is outside tooling we're using for writing software. Part of
that is dogfooding or new products for automated incident resolution and that sort of thing. So that's the first area.
There's a number of other areas that are going to see large improvements on in productivity, typically everything
that has to do with supporting customers, helping with onboarding, helping troubleshoot issues. All of that is in
acceleration. In the end, we expect to see improvements everywhere from front office to back office.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick Walravens Q
Analyst, Citizens JMP Securities
Thank you. And then the follow-up on that is, do you see your efficiency as an organization overall increasing
where you can just grow with sort of the same number of people? Do you feel like in the future, you're going to
need to add the same amount of head count to drive growth as you do today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Olivier Pomel A
Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder & Director, Datadog, Inc.
Well, I mean, in general, just to level set, we are very efficient as an organization already. Like we have really
sales efficiency metrics. We've been highly innovative, growing fast and at the same time, we've shown that we
could deliver very good margins all the way to bottom line. So I consider ourselves to be a very efficient
organization.
Right now, any productivity we gain on the R&D side is reinvested in building more and developing more
functionality and generating more growth. I would say in the short- to mid-term, we should expect also that any

Datadog, Inc.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 13-Feb-2025
productivity we gain on the other side of the business is also going to be reinvested in R&D and building more and
getting more differentiation or in getting more scale faster on the GTM side. So for the short to midterm, that
should be the expectation. Long term, I was always expecting us to be a very efficient company and a highly
profitable company. And I think all of those advances are only going to emphasize that.

planned, whether that's on the go-to-market on scaling the company, on the product development side for 2025.
So I'm really impatient to see how this unfolds and to share with everyone and our customers, in particular,
everything we've been working on. So thank you all.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2025
All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless
otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for
assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.
Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our
prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available.
Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission,
in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the
Microsoft Investor Relations website.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other
statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are
subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's
earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our
Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not
undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.

Satya Nadella
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Thank you, Brett. This quarter, we saw continued strength in Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $40 billion in
revenue for the first time, up 21% year-over-year. Enterprises are beginning to move from proof of concepts to
enterprise-wide deployments to unlock the full ROI of AI. And our AI business has now surpassed an annual
revenue run rate of $13 billion, up 175% year-over-year.
Before I get into the details of the quarter, I want to comment on the core thesis behind our approach to how we
manage our fleet and how we allocate our capital to compute. AI scaling laws are continue to compound across
both pre-training and inference time compute. We ourselves have been seeing significant efficiency gains in both
training and inference for years now.
On inference, we have typically seen more than 2x price performance gain for every hardware generation and
more than 10x for every model generation due to software optimizations. And as AI becomes more efficient and
accessible, we will see exponentially more demand. Therefore, much as we have done with the commercial
cloud, we are focused on continuously scaling our fleet globally and maintaining the right balance across training
and inference as well as geo distribution. From now on, it's a more continuous cycle governed by both revenue
growth and capability growth, thanks to the compounding effects of software-driven AI scaling laws and Moore's
Law.
With that, I will walk through the progress we are making across every layer of the tech stack. Azure is the
infrastructure layer for AI, we continue to expand our data center capacity in line with both near-term and long-
term demand signals. We have more than doubled our overall datacenter capacity in the last three years, and we
have added more capacity last year than any other year in our history. Our datacenters, networks, racks and
silicon are all coming together as a complete system to drive new efficiencies to power both the cloud workloads
of today and the next generation AI workloads.

We continue to take advantage of Moore's Law and refresh our fleet as evidenced by our support of the latest
from AMD, Intel, NVIDIA as well as our first-party silicon innovation from Maia, Cobalt, Boost and HSM. When it
comes to cloud migrations, we continue to see customers like UBS move workloads to Azure. UBS alone
migrated mainframe workloads encompassing nearly 400 billion records and 2 petabytes of data. And we remain
the cloud of choice for customers' mission-critical Oracle, SAP and VMware apps.
At the data layer, we are seeing Microsoft Fabric breakout. We now have over 19,000 paid customers from
Hitachi to Johnson Controls, to Schaeffler. Fabric is now the fastest-growing analytics product in our history.
Power BI is also deeply integrated with Fabric with over 30 million monthly active users, up 40% since last year.
Beyond Fabric, we are seeing new AI-driven data patterns emerge. If you look underneath ChatGPT or Copilot or
Enterprise AI apps, you see the growth of raw storage, database services and app platform services as these
workloads scale. The number of Azure OpenAI apps running on Azure databases and Azure App Services more
than doubled year-over-year, driving significant growth in adoption across SQL Hyperscale and Cosmos DB.
Now, on to AI platform and tools. As we shared last week, we are thrilled OpenAI has made a new large Azure
commitment. Through our strategic partnership, we continue to benefit mutually from each other's growth. And
with OpenAI's APIs exclusively running on Azure, customers can count on us to get access to the world's leading
models. And OpenAI has a lot more coming soon, so stay tuned.
Azure AI Foundry features best-in-class tooling, runtimes to build agents, multi-agent apps, AI ops, API access to
thousands of models. Two months in, we already have more than 200,000 monthly active users, and we are well-
positioned with our support of both OpenAI's leading models and the best selection of open source models and
SLMs.
DeepSeek's R1 launched today via the model catalog on Foundry and GitHub, with automated red teaming,
content safety integration and security scanning. Our Phi family of SLMs has now been downloaded over 20
million times. And we also have more than 30 models from partners like Bayer, Paige.AI, Rockwell Automation,
Siemens to address industry-specific use cases.
With AI, how we build, deploy and maintain code is fundamentally changing, and GitHub Copilot is increasingly
the tool of choice for both digital natives like ASOS and Spotify, as well as world's largest enterprises like HP,
HSBC and KPMG. We have been delighted by the early response to GitHub Copilot in VS Code with more than 1
million sign-ups in just the first week post launch. All up, GitHub now is home to 150 million developers, up 50%
over the past two years.
Now, on to the future of work. Microsoft 365 Copilot is the UI for AI. It helps supercharge employee productivity
and provides access to a swarm of intelligent agents to streamline employee workflow. We are seeing
accelerated customer adoption across all deal sizes, as we win new Microsoft 365 Copilot customers and see the
majority of existing enterprise customers come back to purchase more seats. When you look at customers who
purchased Copilot during the first quarter of availability, they have expanded their seats collectively by more than
10x over the past 18 months.
To share just one example, Novartis has added thousands of seats each quarter over the past year and now have
40,000 seats. Barclays, Carrier Group, Pearson and University of Miami all purchased 10,000 or more seats this
quarter. And overall, the number of people who use Copilot daily again more than doubled quarter-over-quarter.
Employees are also engaging with Copilot more than ever. Usage intensity increased more than 60% quarter-

over-quarter and we are expanding our TAM with Copilot Chat, which was announced earlier this month. Copilot
Chat, along with Copilot Studio, is now available to every employee to start using agents right in the flow of work.
With Copilot Studio, we are making it as simple to build an agent as it is to create an Excel spreadsheet. More
than 160,000 organizations have already used Copilot Studio, and they collectively created more than 400,000
custom agents in the last three months alone, up over 2x quarter-over-quarter.
We've also introduced our own first-party agents to facilitate meetings, manage projects, resolve common HR and
IT queries, and access SharePoint data. And we also continue to see partners like Adobe, SAP, ServiceNow and
Workday build their third-party agents and integrate with Copilot.
What is driving Copilot as the UI for AI, as well as our momentum with agents is our rich data cloud, which is the
world's largest source of organizational knowledge. Billions of emails, documents and chats, hundreds of millions
of Teams meetings and millions of SharePoint sites are added each day. This is the enterprise knowledge cloud.
It is growing fast, up over 25% year-over-year.
More broadly, what we are seeing is Copilot, plus agents, disrupting business applications and we are leaning into
this. With Dynamics 365, we took share as organizations like Ecolab, Lenovo, RTX, TotalEnergies and Vizient
switched to our AI-powered apps from legacy providers. In healthcare, DAX Copilot surpassed 2 million monthly
physician-patient encounters, up 54% quarter-over-quarter. It is being used by top providers like Mass General
Brigham, Michigan Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center to increase productivity of their physicians.
When it comes to Windows, we are seeing momentum build as we approach end of support for Windows 10.
Customers are choosing the latest Windows 11 devices for their enhanced security and advanced AI capabilities.
15% of premium-priced laptops in the US this holiday were Copilot+ PCs, and we expect the majority of PCs sold
in the next several years to be Copilot+ PCs. We also see more and more developers from Adobe and CapCut, to
WhatsApp, build apps that leverage built-in NPUs. And they will soon be able to run DeepSeek's R1 distilled
models locally on Copilot+ PCs, as well as the vast ecosystem of GPUs available on Windows. And beyond
Copilot+ PCs, the most powerful AI workstation for local development is a Windows PC running WSL 2 powered
by NVIDIA RTX GPUs.
Now on to security. We continue to make progress with our Secure Future Initiative, and we are applying what we
have learned, introducing over 80 new product capabilities over the past year. With Security Copilot,
organizations across private and public sector like City of Johannesburg, Eastman, Intesa, National Australia
Bank, NTT, can resolve incidents 30% faster. Data governance is increasingly critical and customers now use
Microsoft Purview to audit over 2 billion Copilot interactions for safe and compliant use.
Now, on to our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn. More professionals than ever are engaging in high-
value conversations on LinkedIn, with comments up 37% year-over-year. Short-form video continues to grow on
the platform with video creation all up growing at twice the rate of other post formats. We're also innovating with
agents to help recruiters and small businesses find qualified candidates faster, and our hiring business, again
took share. In subscriptions, LinkedIn Premium surpassed $2 billion in annual revenue for the first time this
quarter. Subscriber growth has increased nearly 50% over the past two years, and nearly 40% of subscribers
have used our AI features to improve their profiles and LinkedIn Marketing Solutions remains the leader in B2B
advertising.
Now on to search, advertising and news. We once again took share across Bing and Edge, Edge surpassed 30%
market share in the US on Windows and has taken share for 15 consecutive quarters. The investments we have

made in improving our ad rates are paying off and advertisers increasingly see our network as an essential
platform to optimize ROI. And our Copilot consumer app is seeing increased engagement and retention with its
improved speed, unique personality, first of its kind features like Copilot Vision. Just today, we made Think
Deeper powered by o1, free for all Copilot users globally.
Now on to gaming. We are focused on improving the profitability of the business in order to position it for long-
term growth, driven by higher margin content and platform services, and we are delivering on this plan. Black Ops
6 was top selling game on Xbox and PlayStation this quarter and saw more players in its launch quarter than any
other paid release in the franchise history. And we saw rave reviews of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which
has already been played by more than 4 million people.
We also continue to see strong momentum for Xbox Cloud Gaming with a record 140 million hours streamed this
quarter. All up, Game Pass set a new quarterly record for revenue and grew its PC subscriber base by over 30%
as we focus on driving fully paid subscribers across endpoints. In closing, we continue to innovate across our tech
stack to help our customers in this AI era, and I'm energized by the many opportunities ahead.
With that, let me turn it over to Amy.

Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone.
This quarter revenue was $69.6 billion, up 12%. Gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant
currency, while operating income increased 17% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $3.23,
an increase of 10%.
We delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth. Results were driven by strong demand
for our cloud and AI offerings, while we also improved our operating leverage with higher-than-expected operating
income growth.
As you heard from Satya, our AI business annual revenue run rate surpassed $13 billion and was above
expectations. Commercial bookings increased 67% and 75% in constant currency and were significantly ahead of
expectations, driven by Azure commitments from OpenAI. Execution was strong across our core annuity sales
motions, with growth in the number of $100 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365.
Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $298 billion, up 34% and 36% in constant currency.
Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 21% year-over-year. The remaining portion
recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 45%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 97%.
FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with expectations on total company
revenue, More Personal Computing revenue, total company COGS, and operating expense. FX decreased
revenue more than expected in our commercial segments.
Microsoft Cloud revenue was $40.9 billion and grew 21%. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 70%, in
line with expectations and decreased 2 points year-over-year, driven by scaling our AI infrastructure.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2025
Company gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to 69%, primarily driven by sales mix shift to
higher margin businesses as well as improvement in Gaming and Search, partially offset by the impact of scaling
our AI infrastructure.
Operating expenses increased 5% lower than expected and operating margins increased 2 points year-over-year
to 45%. The better-than-expected margin expansion was driven by delivering efficiencies across our businesses
as we invest to scale AI infrastructure and build AI applications.
At a total company level, head count at the end of December was 2% higher than a year ago, and was relatively
unchanged from last quarter.
Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $29.4 billion and grew 14%
and 13% in constant currency even with the unfavorable FX impact noted earlier. Results were ahead of
expectations driven by Microsoft 365 Commercial.
Microsoft 365 Commercial Cloud revenue increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, slightly ahead of
expectations due to better-than-expected performance in E5 and Microsoft 365 Copilot. With M365 Copilot, we
continue to see growth in adoption, expansion and usage. ARPU growth was again driven by E5 and M365
copilot. Paid M365 Commercial seats grew 7% year-over-year, with installed base expansion across all customer
segments though primarily in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings.
M365 Commercial products revenue increased 13% significantly ahead of expectations, driven by higher-than-
expected transactional purchasing with the launch of Office 2024 as well as the Windows commercial on-
premises components from the better-than-expected formats of M365 suite noted earlier.
M365 Consumer Cloud revenue increased 8%, slightly ahead of expectations. We saw a continued momentum in
M365 consumer subscriptions, which grew 10% to $86.3 million with mix shift to M365 Basic.
LinkedIn revenue increased 9% with continued growth across all lines of business. In our Talent Solutions
business, results were slightly below expectations driven by continued weakness in the hiring market in key
verticals. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 19% and 18% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations
with growth across all workloads.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage
decreased slightly year-over-year, driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 6% and
operating income increased 16% and 15% in constant currency.
Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $25.5 billion and grew 19% with more unfavorable FX impact
than expected. Excluding the unfavorable FX impact, results in Azure non-AI services, on-prem server, and
Enterprise and Partner services were slightly lower than expected, partially offset by better-than-expected results
in Azure AI services.
Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31%. Azure growth included 13 points from AI services, which grew
157% year-over-year and was ahead of expectations even as demand continued to be higher than our available
capacity.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2025
Growth in our non-AI services was slightly lower than expected due to go-to-market execution challenges,
particularly with our customers that we primarily reach through our scale motions, as we balance driving near-
term non-AI consumption with AI growth.
In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 3%, slightly below expectations, driven by slower-than-
expected purchasing around Windows Server 2025 launch. Enterprise and Partner Services revenue decreased
1%, below expectations with lower-than-expected performance across Enterprise Support Services and Industry
Solutions.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 12% and 13% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage
decreased 4 points year-over-year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 10% and
operating income grew 14%.
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.7 billion, relatively unchanged year-over-year, with better-
than-expected results driven primarily by Windows OEM prebuilds. Usage from a third-party partnership in Search
as well as Call of Duty launch performance in gaming. Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 4% year-
over-year ahead of expectations, driven by commercial inventory builds in advance of Windows 10 end of support
as well as uncertainty around tariffs.
Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 21% and 20% in constant currency, ahead of
expectations, driven by usage from a third-party partnership. Growth continues to be driven by rate expansion and
healthy volume growth in both Edge and Bing.
And in Gaming, revenue decreased 7% and 8% in constant currency as content and services growth continued to
be offset by hardware declines. Xbox content and services revenue increased 2% ahead of expectations driven
by stronger-than-expected performance in Blizzard and Activision content, including Call of Duty.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased
6 points year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses as well as strong execution on
margin improvement in Gaming and Search. Operating expenses decreased 1%. Operating income increased
32% and 30% in constant currency, driven by continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities.
Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $22.6 billion, in line with
expectations and cash paid for PP&E was $15.8 billion. More than half of our cloud and AI-related spend was on
long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud and AI
spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customers based on demand signals, including
our customer contracted backlog.
Cash flow from operations was $22.3 billion, up 18%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially
offset by higher supplier, employee and tax payments. Free cash flow was $6.5 billion, down 29% year-over-year,
reflecting the capital expenditures noted earlier. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $2.3
billion, lower than our October guidance due to the impairment charge from our Cruise investment. Our effective
tax rate came in slightly lower than anticipated at 18%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders
through dividends and share repurchases.
Now moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. First, FX. With
the strengthening of the US dollar since October, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by 2 points.
Within the segments, we expect FX to decrease revenue growth by 2 points in Productivity and Business

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2025
Processes, and Intelligent Cloud, and roughly 1 point in More Personal Computing. When compared to our
October guidance assumptions on Q3 FX impact, this is a decrease to total revenue of roughly $1 billion. We
expect FX to decrease COGS growth by approximately 2 points, and operating expense growth by approximately
1 point.
Our outlook has many of the trends we saw in Q2 continue through Q3. Demand for our differentiated cloud and
AI offerings across the Microsoft Cloud should drive another quarter of strong growth. In commercial bookings,
with a relatively flat expiry base and the strong prior year comparable in terms of large Azure contracts, we expect
growth to be roughly flat year-over-year. We expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions
and continued long-term commitments to our platform.
As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased
quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 69%,
down year-over-year, driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure.
Next, to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11%
and 12% in constant currency or $29.4 billion to $29.7 billion. Microsoft 365 Commercial Cloud revenue growth
should be between 14% and 15% in constant currency, relatively stable compared to our better-than-expected Q2
results.
We expect continued ARPU growth through E5 and M365 Copilot, and we again expect some seat growth
moderation given the size of the installed base. For M365 Commercial products, we expect revenue to be
relatively unchanged year-over-year. As a reminder, M365 Commercial products include Windows Commercial
on-premises components of M365 suites. So, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-
period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in
the mid to high single digits, driven by M365 subscriptions.
For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid single-digits. Although, we expect growth across all
businesses, the Q2 trends in Talent Solutions should continue in Q3 as a headwind to growth. And in Dynamics
365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid-teens, driven by continued growth across all workloads.
For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or $25.9 billion to
$26.2 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability
primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue
growth to be between 31% and 32% in constant currency, driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services.
As we shared in October, the contribution from our AI services will grow from increased AI capacity coming
online. In non-AI services, healthy growth continues, although we expect ongoing impacts through H2 as we work
to address the execution challenges noted earlier. And while we expect to be AI capacity constrained in Q3, by
the end of FY 2025, we should be roughly in line with near-term demand, given our significant capital
investments.
In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid single digits, driven by a decrease in
transactional purchasing. And in Enterprise and Partner Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to
mid single digits.
In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be $12.4 billion to $12.8 billion, with continued prioritization of
higher margin opportunities. Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the low to mid single digits.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2025
We expect revenue from Windows OEM to be relatively flat year-over-year, as our outlook assumes inventory
levels will normalize. Actual results may differ based on current tariff uncertainties. Devices revenue will decline.
Search and news advertising, ex-TAC revenue growth, should be in the mid-teens from continued growth in both
volume and revenue per search, with share gains across Edge and Bing. Growth is expected to moderate from
last quarter, primarily due to additional FX impact, and as the third-party partnership usage noted earlier returns to
more normal levels. Search, ex-TAC growth will be higher than overall Search and news advertising revenue
growth, which we expect to be in the mid to high single digits.
And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth be in the low single-digits. We expect Xbox content and services
revenue growth to be in the low to mid single-digits, driven by first-party content as well as Xbox Game Pass.
Hardware revenue will decline year-over-year.
Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency, or to be
between $21.65 billion to $21.85 billion, and operating expense to grow between 5% and 6% in constant
currency, or to be between $16.4 billion and $16.5 billion.
Other income and expense is expected to be roughly negative $1 billion, primarily driven by investments
accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on
equity method investments. And lastly, we expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%.
Now, some additional thoughts on the rest of the fiscal year and beyond. First, FX. With the strengthening of the
US dollar since October, we now expect FX to decrease Q4 revenue and COGS growth by more than 1 point and
operating expense growth by roughly 1 point. Next, capital expenditures. We expect quarterly spend in Q3 and
Q4 to remain at similar levels as our Q2 spend. In FY 2026, we expect to continue investing against strong
demand signals, including customer contracted backlog we need to deliver against across the entirety of our
Microsoft Cloud.
However, the growth rate will be lower than FY 2025 and the mix of spend will begin to shift back to short-lived
assets, which are more correlated to revenue growth. As a reminder, our long-lived infrastructure investments are
fungible, enabling us to remain agile as we meet customer demand globally across our Microsoft Cloud, including
AI workloads. As always, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the
timing of delivery of finance leases.
For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth as we focus on
delivering efficiencies across both COGS and operating expense. And given the operating leverage that we've
delivered throughout the year, inclusive of efficiency gains as we scale our AI infrastructure and utilize our own AI
solutions, we now expect FY 2025 operating margins to be up slightly year-over-year. And finally, our FY 2025 full
year effective tax rate should be between 18% and 19%.
In closing, we are committed to delivering real-world AI solutions to help customers grow and improve their
results. We are confident in our leadership position as we grow with our customers.
Before turning to Q&A, I have one special thank you. Brett Iversen is moving to a new role here as the Head of
our Americas sales finance team. On behalf of the company, thank you for your tremendous impact, leading

Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. And echoing Amy's comments, Brett, congratulations on the
new role. It's been a pleasure working with you and best of luck in that new role. Looking at the quarter, another
really solid quarter when it comes to commercial bookings. But again, we were a little bit disappointed on Azure
coming in at the bottom end of the guidance range. Amy, I was hoping you could dig into perhaps what some of
those execution issues were, what the resolution to those issues were? And do we still feel comfortable in the
acceleration into the back half of the year that you were talking about after the June quarter and after last quarter?
Thank you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Amy E. Hood A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Keith. Let me spend a little time on that about what we saw in Q2 and give you some additional
background on the near-term execution issues that we're talking about. First, let me be very specific. They are in
the non-AI ACR component. Our Azure AI results were better than we thought due to very good work by the
operating teams pulling in some delivery dates even by weeks. When your capacity constrained weeks matter,
and it was good execution by the team, and you see that in the revenue results.
On the non-AI side, really the challenges were in what we call the scale motions. So, think about primarily these
are customers we reach through partners and through more indirect methods of selling. And really, the art form
there is as these customers, which we reach in this way are trying to balance how do you do an AI workload with
continuing some of the work they've done on migrations and other fundamentals, we then took our sales motions
in the summer and really change to try to balance those two.
As you do that, you learn with your customers and with your partners on sort of getting that balance right between
where to put our investments, where to put the marketing dollars, and importantly, where to put people in terms of
coverage and being able to help customers make those transitions. And I think we are going to make some
adjustments to make sure we are in balance because when you make those changes in the summer, by the time
it works its way through the system, you can see the impacts on whether you have that balance right.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2025
And so, the teams are working through that. They're already making adjustments. And I expect while we will see
some impact through H2 just because when you work through the scale motion, it can take some time for that to
adjust. I feel good that the teams understand and are working through that. So hopefully, that's just helpful on
that. Then, we talked a little bit about Q3. And so, we've talked about 31% to 32% after publishing a 31% this
quarter. Our AI results that we had felt good and talked about our ability to land that revenue is the same. So
again, in Q3, we are working from a pretty constrained capacity place. And that's no different than it was our
expectation to be in that position last October when I talked to you all.
And when I talk about being at a capacity constraint, it takes two things. You have to have space, which I
generally call long-lived assets, right? That's the infrastructure and the land, and then you have to have kits.
We're continuing, and you've seen that's why our spend has pivoted this way to be in the long-lived investment.
We have been short, power and space. And so, as you see those investments land that we've made over the past
three years, we get closer to that balance by the end of this year. And so, the confidence on the AI side continues
to be there in terms of being able to sell, utilize and be, I think, encouraged by the signals. What we're seeing is
waiting to see just how the non-AI ACR works through the scale motions in H2. But in general, the only thing that
changed is really that scale motion from my seat. Keith, I hope that's helpful. Satya?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Satya Nadella A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Yeah. I think, Amy, just one thing I'd add, Keith, to your question is, as Amy said, the AI growth rate is actually
better than what we expected, and we worked through some of the supply stuff and more importantly, some of the
workloads are scaling well. And when you look underneath any of these AI workloads, the other thing that is good
is the ratio of even what we would call just regular storage, data services, app services. So, underneath a
ChatGPT or a Copilot or even these emerging AI workloads in the enterprise. So, that's all good.
The enterprise workloads, whether it's SAP or whether it's VMware migrations, what have you, that's also in good
shape. And it's just the scale place where Amy talked about this nuance, right? How do you really tweak the
incentives, go-to-market? At a time of platform shifts, you kind of want to make sure you lean into even the new
design wins, and you just don't keep doing the stuff that you did in the previous generation. And that's the art form
Amy was referencing to, make sure you get the right balance. But let me put it this way. You would rather win the
new than just protect the past. And that's sort of one another thing that we definitely will lean into always.

Thank you very much for taking my question. Can you give more color on what drove the four larger than
expected Microsoft AI revenue? We talked a bit about the Azure AI component of it. But can you give more color
on that? And our estimates are that the Copilot was much bigger than we had expected and growing much faster.
Any more details on the breakdown of what that Microsoft AI would be great. Thanks.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2025
Thanks, Mark, for the question. Yes, that was, as we talked about better than expected, a couple of pieces to that,
which you've correctly identified. Number one is the Azure component we just talked about. And the second
piece, you're right, Microsoft Copilot was better. And what was important about that it was – we saw strength both
in seats, both new seats and expansion seats, as Satya talked about, and usage, which doesn't directly impact
revenue, but of course, indirectly does as people get more and more value added. And also price per seat was
actually quite good. We still have a good signal for value. So, those are the biggest pieces, Mark, of that sort of
outperformance in terms of our expectations.

Brent Thill Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Satya, you mentioned DeepSeek a couple of times in your prepared remarks. I think everyone would love
your thoughts on what you're seeing there. And are we seeing AI scale now at lower cost? Are we reaching a
mark where you can see that? Or do we still have some time to go? Thanks for your thoughts on this.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Satya Nadella A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Brent. So, yeah, in my remarks, I talked about how, in some sense, what's happening with AI is no
different than what was happening with the regular compute cycle. It's always about bending the curve and then
putting more points up the curve. So, there's Moore's Law that's working in hyperdrive. Then on top of that, there
is the AI scaling laws, both the pre-training and the inference time compute that compound, and that's all
software. You should think of what I said in my remarks, which we have observed for a while, which is 10x on
improvements per cycle just because of all the software optimizations on inference. And so, that's what you see.
And add to that, I think DeepSeek has had some real innovations. And that is some of the things that even
OpenAI, found in o1. And so, we are going to – obviously, now that all gets commoditized, and it's going to get
broadly used. And the big beneficiaries of any software cycle like that is the customers, right? Because at the end
of the day, if you think about it, right, what was the big lesson learned from client server to cloud, more people
bought servers except it was called cloud.
And so, when token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there'll
be more apps written. And it's interesting to see that when I referenced these models that are pretty powerful, it's
unimaginable to think that here we are in sort of beginning of 2025 where on the PC, you can run a model that
requires pretty massive cloud infrastructure. So, that type of optimizations means AI will be much more
ubiquitous. And so, therefore, for a hyperscaler like us, a PC platform provider like us, this is all good news as far
as I'm concerned.

Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please.

Operator: The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Karl E. Keirstead Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thank you. Maybe this one as well for Satya, and it's also away from the numbers. But Satya, I wanted to ask you
about the Stargate news and the announced changes in the OpenAI relationship last week. It seems that most of
your investors have interpreted this as Microsoft, for sure, remaining very committed to OpenAI's success, but
electing to take more of a backseat in terms of funding OpenAI's future training CapEx needs. I was hoping you
might frame your strategic decision here around Stargate, and Amy, whether there's any takeaway for investors
from that decision in terms of how you're thinking about CapEx needs over the next several years? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Satya Nadella A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Yeah. Thanks for the question. So, we remain very happy with the partnership with OpenAI. And as you saw, they
have committed in a big way to Azure, and even in the bookings, what we recognize is just the first tranche of it.
And so, you'll see, we've given the ROFR. We have more benefits of that even into the future. And obviously, their
success is our success because we will know the other commercial arrangements that we detailed out in the blog
that we put out even commensurate with that announcement.
But to your overall point, the thing that I'd say is we are building a pretty fungible fleet, right? We're making sure
that there's the right balance between training and inference, it's geo-distributed. We are working super hard on
all the software optimizations, right? I mean, just not the software optimizations that come because of what
DeepSeek has done, but all the work we have done to, for example, reduce the prices of GPT models over the
years in partnership with OpenAI. In fact, we did a lot of the work on the inference optimizations on it, and that's
been key to driving, right?
One of the key things to note in AI is you just don't launch the frontier model, but if it's too expensive to serve, it's
no good, right? It won't generate any demand. So, you've got to have that optimization, so that inferencing costs
are coming down and they can be consumed broadly. And so, that's the fleet physics we are managing. And also,
remember, you don't want to buy too much of anything at one time because the Moore's Law every year is going
to give you 2x, your optimization is going to give you 10x. You want to continuously upgrade the fleet, modernize
the fleet, age the fleet, and at the end of the day, have the right ratio of monetization and demand-driven
monetization to what you think of as the training expense. So, I feel very good about the investment we are
making and it's fungible and it just allows us to scale more long-term business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Amy E. Hood A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Microsoft Corp.
And maybe, Karl, just to reiterate a little of the comments that I made on CapEx, because I think it's helpful
surround a bit more in what Satya is saying a fungible fleet means. We have, and I think we talked about it, close
to $300 billion of RPO, that is committed customer contracts that need to be deliver on. And the faster we can do
that and the more efficiently we can do that, the better off we are, not just the OpenAI partnership, which is a
piece of that, but with the entire platform that we need to deliver for our customers.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2025
And I think the other thing that sometimes missing is when we say fungible, we mean not just the primary use,
which we've always talked about, which is inference, but there is some training, post-training, which is a key
component. And then, they're just running the commercial cloud, which, at every layer under an every modern AI
app that's going to be built, will be required. It will be required to be distributed, and it'll be required to be global.
And all of those things are really important, because it then means you're the most efficient. And so, the
investment you see is making CapEx, you're right, the front-end has been this sort of infrastructure build that lets
us really catch up not just on the AI infrastructure we needed, think about that as the building itself, datacenters,
but also some of the catch-up we needed to do on the commercial cloud side.
And then, you'll see the pivot to more CPU and GPU. And that pivot will more directly correlate to revenue, and it
will be contracted either with the partnership that you asked about with OpenAI or with others. And so, I do think
the way I want everyone to internalize it is that the CapEx growth is going through that cycle pivot, which is far
more correlated to customer contact delivery, no matter who the end customer is.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Zelnick Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you very much for taking my question and I'll echo my congrats and gratitude to Brett as well. Satya, as we
think about Microsoft's very rich Copilot portfolio, now having been in market for over a year, with the products
and precision only getting better and the cost of inference coming down, how do you think about the journey from
here and perhaps the ability to package and evolve the go-to-market to address the broadest range of customers
and customer requirements out there? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Satya Nadella A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Thanks, Brad, for the question. In fact, you saw us make two announcements recently. One is on the M365
Copilot side, we now have the Copilot Chat. So this is now going to be broadly deployed across the entire
installed base effectively, because you can go have this now turned on by IT and everybody can start using web-
grounded chat with all the enterprise controls right away and it has Copilot Studio built in. And so that means they
can start building agents. So, we think of that plus the full Copilot as a good combination that I think will
accelerate, quite frankly, in terms of just seat usage and agent building and what have you. So that's sort of one.
And the other thing is you also see even on the consumer side, we just yesterday launched o1 or the Think
Harder (sic) [Think Deeper] (00:50:20) feature on Copilot now that's powered by o1, it's available globally, right.
So you can see the benefits of inference optimization and the cost coming down, means you can drive more
ubiquity of what were features that ones were sort of premium tier, and that's all definitely something that we will

do across, right. The same thing is happening in GitHub Copilot, same thing in Security Copilot, so across the
length and breadth of our portfolio, you'll see that.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Reback Q
Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
That's great. Thank you very much. Satya, if you look out several years, any sense of what percent of inference
done on Azure will be done on proprietary models versus open models. And with that said, does it matter to
Microsoft at the end of the day? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Satya Nadella A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Yeah, it's a good question, because at some level, what you're seeing is effectively lots of models that get used in
any application, right? When you look underneath even a Copilot or a GitHub Copilot or what have you, you
already see lots of many different models that you build models, you fine tune models, you distill models. Some of
them are models that you distill into an open source model. So, there's going to be a combination. So, we've
always maintained that it's always good to have front tier models. You want to always build your application with
high ambition using the best model that is available and then optimize from thereon.
So, that's also on another side, like there's a temporality to it, right? What you start with as a given COGS profile
doesn't need to be the end because you continuously optimize for latency in COGS and putting in different
models. And in fact, all that complexity, by the way, has to be managed by a new app server. So, one of the
things that we are investing heavily on is Foundry because from an app developer perspective, you kind of want
to keep pace with these flurry of models that are coming in and you want to have an evergreen way for your
application to benefit from all that innovation. But not have all the dev cost or the DevOps cost or what people talk
about AI Ops costs. So, we are also investing significantly in all the app server for any workload to be able to
benefit from all these different models, open source, close source, different weight classes and at the same time
from an operations perspective, it's faster, easier for you.

Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Sills Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Wonderful. Thank you so much. Great to hear about the strength you're seeing in Copilot. Would love to get some
color as to where you're seeing that strength? Is it departmental deals, your customers moving from proof-of-
concept to departmental deals maybe multiple departmental deals in the enterprise? You mentioned some uptick
in usage trends. Would love to get some color on just the common use cases that you're seeing that give you that
confidence that that will ramp into monetization later? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Satya Nadella A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft Corp.
Yes. I mean, I think the initial sort of set of seats were for places where there's more belief in immediate
productivity, a sales team, in finance or in supply chain, where there is a lot of like, for example, SharePoint
rounded data that you want to be able to use in conjunction with web data and have it produce results that are
beneficial. But then, what's happening, very much like what we have seen in the previous generation productivity
things is that people collaborate across functions, across roles, right? For example, even in my own daily habit is,
I go to Chat, I use Work tab and get results, and then I immediately share using Pages with colleagues.
I sort of call it think with AI and work with people. And that pattern then requires you to make it more of a standard
issue across the enterprise. And so that's what we are seeing. It starts maybe at a department level, quickly the
collaboration network effects will effectively demand that you spread it across. You can do it by cohort and what
have you. And so, what we've made it easier even is to start with Copilot Chat [indiscernible] (00:54:56) so that
gives the enterprise customers even more flexibility to have something that's more ubiquitous.

Brent A. Bracelin Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thanks for taking the question here. Good afternoon. I wanted to go back to commercial bookings, commercial
RPO, I think increased $39 billion sequentially that's the most we've ever seen on a sequential basis, commercial
bookings growth, 75% constant currency. That's 2x higher than we've seen in the last decade. I appreciate there's
some volatility with this metric, but it does feel like this quarter there was a bit of sea change relative to
momentum on backlog and bookings. Can you just talk about maybe the breadth of where that strength came
from? Was it broad-based? Was there a couple of large deals? Any color there would be helpful? Thanks.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2025
Thanks, Brent. It's a great question. We talked a little bit about what are the main drivers, which was one of the
Azure commitments that OpenAI has made. And I do want to say, well, that is obviously a big component, you'll
continue to see OpenAI make commitment. So I don't – I want to separate the concept that it's one-time versus an
ongoing relationship that will grow as they grow, which should absolutely well.
And to your question on what else is participating in that number. First, we did have very good core motions. Our
core motions are things like, to your point, renewals of our existing contracts, add-on to those contracts upsell
like, for example, Copilot or GitHub Copilot or other processes and I think that's important, we also had a good E5
quarter, which when we talk a lot about M365 Copilot, I sometimes forget just also talk about suite momentum.
And we saw that as well this quarter, which we felt very good about. And then the final component is large Azure
commitments. And those really did look as we affected, which is good.
To your point, and that you're seeing a really broad-based growth, those Azure commitments take two forms.
One, it's existing customers who've worked through their commitments are making larger commitments, which is
a good commitment sign for the platform. And then you have new customers making commitments, and we also
saw that this quarter. And so to your point, sometimes I think a big number that looks like this can make you think
it's just one thing. I think you're right. Some of it was one thing, but a lot of it was good execution consistently
across the workloads.

Steve McMillan
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Thank you, Chad. And hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In 2024, we delivered $609 million in cloud
ARR and $1.474 billion of total ARR. As we advanced in our strategy with our hybrid cloud platform for trusted AI.
As we discussed on the last call, we see that companies everywhere are exploring how to best leverage the
potential of AI and GenAI, and they are realizing the requirement for managing massive volumes of data that will
grow exponentially. Before we get into the details of our results, we also announce that Claire Bramley is moving
on from Teradata to take a Chief Financial Officer position at another company outside of our industry. We have a
search process underway. And Charles Smotherman, our Chief Accounting Officer, will assume the Interim CFO
position. Charles will continue to work closely with clear to ensure a seamless transition until her departure on
March 31st. Claire has been instrumental in supporting the company's transformation to a cloud leader. We are
grateful for her operational excellence and outstanding financial leadership in driving durable profitability and free
cash flow during her tenure. Claire, on behalf of everyone at Teradata, we wish you the best in your new role.
Shifting back to our results. Despite a challenging year, we took significant actions in 2024 that position us to
return to total ARR growth this year. We named a new CRO, restructured our go-to-market organization, and
executed cost actions that reduced expenses across the business. We also reoriented the organization to win
with AI, and introduced a sweeping set of innovations designed to strongly position us with our hybrid trusted AI
platform. As we pivoted to AI, we also launched new partnerships, with, for example, NVIDIA, and strengthened
partnerships with the major CSPs. We are firmly focused on returning the company to growth in 2025. And
execution is job number one.
Our go-to-market organization has settled in from the midyear restructuring and we are expecting continued
improvement in execution from our go-to-market teams. As an example, the financial services team we created is
allowing us to pursue emerging AI-based industry use cases that we believe our technology best enables. We
also have proof-of-concepts underway for generative AI for CX, a major GenAI use case. Additionally, we are
releasing a series of customer experience AI use cases that customers can quickly implement and are designed
to drive improved results around customer churn, next best action, customer journey, and hyper-personalization.
Our customer success team is doubling down on delivering innovation based, curated to each customer's needs,
and helping to extend the deployment of our technology across their base. In 2025, we are expecting a
meaningful improvement in retention rates over 2024 for both total and on-prem ARR. We started to see
improvement in retention rates in the second half of 2024 and are looking to carry that forward this year. With
these initiatives taking hold, we believe we are well-positioned to execute and return to growth this year.
Just as we made a pivot in 2020 to cloud-first we started to pivot in 2024 towards being the trusted hybrid AI
platform at enterprise scale. Companies have data both in the cloud and on-prem, and we see them becoming
more sophisticated in how they think about leveraging and balancing hybrid capabilities. It's not about choosing
between environments anymore, it's about effectively operating across both in order to meet diverse business
needs, and drive faster decision-making at the scale they require. Our teams are taking our hybrid cloud platform

and trusted AI positioning to our customers. We believe our hybrid capabilities of cloud and on-prem, along with
our open and connected approach are unmatched.
We are continuing our disciplined approach to managing our financial plan, investing and extending our
technology strengths, and promoting Teradata as a leader in data analytics, trusted AI, and hybrid cloud
technology while prudently managing costs. In 2025, we are adding to our strong tech stack building upon the
broad set of innovations we delivered in 2024. As more companies look to hybrid compute environments in both
cloud and on-prem, increasingly adopt technologies to support AI, and embrace the industry move to open table
formats, we believe we are well-positioned.
On our last call, I talked about the innovations we introduced last quarter. Among those were, new bring your own
large language model capabilities designed to help customers take advantage of small or mid-sized open LLMs,
including domain-specific models to deploy GenAI use cases or minimizing expensive data movement. Integration
of NVIDIA's AI accelerated compute platform to accelerate AI workloads, and our Customer Complaint Analyzer
solution designed to help companies leverage AI to improve customer experiences.
We introduced rapid start GenAI use cases with the integration of our VantageCloud platform with Amazon
Bedrock. With this integration, customers gain access to more than 60 GenAI use cases that can help them
deliver exceptional customer experiences, boost productivity, and streamline business processes. Additionally,
Teradata was one of the early vendors with AI solutions offered in the new Microsoft Fabric Workload Hub. We
also announced API integration with Google Cloud Gemini models designed to take advantage of more data for
better GenAI outcomes. As we start 2025, our focus is on the future as we work to bring out significant new
capabilities designed to help companies bring trusted AI to enterprise scale in the cloud, and in the hybrid
environment customers need.
Let's look at our new Enterprise Vector Store as one example. To get the most value out of generative AI and the
Agentic AI applications, enterprises are looking to extract insights from both structured and unstructured data.
Unstructured data has been difficult to leverage in traditional data management practices, yet is growing three
times faster than other data types. Teradata supports vectors in our Vantage system today for AI applications that
are built on a bring your own large language model capabilities. Now we are bringing it to full enterprise scale.
Our Teradata Enterprise Vector Store is in private preview this quarter, and brings a scalable, in-database
solution that supports the full lifecycle of vector data management at Enterprise Scale. From embedding
generation and indexing to metadata management and intelligent search, all processes are seamlessly integrated
within our existing Vantage environment. Here, we are also partnering with NVIDIA to provide GPU-accelerated
document processing or autonomous AI agent use cases such as augmented call centers. You'll be hearing more
in the coming weeks about this exciting addition that we believe will kick start RAG and Agentic AI applications.
Then, coming shortly afterwards, we are planning to bring our on-prem customers new ways to accelerate AI
opportunities, providing them with an easy way to enable AI/ML capabilities, including large scale AI RAG
pipelines while honoring data sovereignty requirements. We have many customers in regulated industries that
have strict requirements for data security and our new capabilities are designed to enable independent AI without
impacting their EDW service levels.
We believe our deep analytics, our open and connected platform, and bring your own model integrations are the
foundation enterprises will demand and we have these now.

Our strong capabilities were recently recognized in the 2025 Gartner Critical Capabilities report for Cloud
Database Management Systems for Analytical Use Cases. We placed among the top five companies across
every evaluated use case.
Now I'll walk you through a few examples that illustrate how our customers are investing in Teradata to help
address new AI and analytics use cases. One of the largest life insurance companies in India signed a multiyear
deal for a platform and consulting services. This new customer selected Teradata because of the comprehensive
AI capabilities included in ClearScape Analytics, such as model lifecycle management with ModelOps, enterprise
feature store, and in-database language models, as well as our strongly competitive pricing. A large Japanese
bank has shown it can successfully reduce costs and improve processing times by replacing a legacy HPC cluster
used to perform Monte Carlo simulations at huge scale with a system that relies on native massive parallelism
over Vantage platform in conjunction with NVIDIA GPUs.
A global technology leader spent significant time and millions of dollars trying to implement competitive offerings.
After demonstrating our VantageCloud and ClearScape capabilities, this large enterprise decided to focus on a
hybrid environment of cloud and on-prem. We have a fast start in 2025 to help them establish their new data and
AI capabilities, including taking advantage of our GenAI capabilities.
As I close, I want to emphasize that we are laser focused on returning to total ARR growth. Building upon our
technology and innovation foundation in the cloud, we believe we have the trusted hybrid AI platform at the
enterprise scale that the world's leading organizations require.
We're excited about our capabilities in delivering AI and agentic AI solutions at scale, especially in the hybrid
environments customers need now.
We are seeing positive traction from our go-to-market restructuring and improvement in pipeline quality. The pace
of technology innovations, both organically and with partners, has increased, and we look forward to monetizing
these advancements this year.
In 2025, we expect to achieve cloud ARR growth of 14% to 18% and flat to 2% growth in total ARR as we build
our future.
Now I'll turn the call over to Claire.

Claire Bramley
Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q4, Teradata met its guidance ranges for cloud ARR and
total ARR. Cloud ARR grew 18% year-over-year and total ARR declined 4% year-over-year, both in constant
currency.
The cloud net expansion rate was 117% in Q4 2024. Non-GAAP earnings per share exceeded our guidance
range, primarily driven by continued cost optimization efforts implemented in the second half of the year.
While fiscal year 2024 presented challenges in terms of ARR growth, we continue to demonstrate the free cash
flow and earnings durability of the business by exceeding our non-GAAP EPS guidance that we gave at the
beginning of the year.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 11-Feb-2025
Fiscal year 2024, free cash flow of $277 million represents a healthy 16% margin. We also returned 78% of free
cash flow to investors in the form of share repurchases.
As Steve mentioned, we took swift actions last year that we believe will improve execution in 2025. We see
multiple drivers that can enable a return to total ARR growth this year.
These include last year's go-to-market changes that are designed to bring additional rigor to our pipeline and
sales cycles, giving us greater visibility into sales productivity improvements. We also expect improved full year
retention rates.
Lastly, we anticipate monetizing all the innovation we introduced in 2024 and plan to deliver in 2025.
As we exit 2024, cloud ARR is over 40% of total ARR and should approach close to 50% at the end of 2025. We
continue to expect healthy cloud ARR growth of approximately 16% this year. We also see increasing interest in
our hybrid AI differentiation, which should lead to higher on-prem expansion net of migrations.
Let me now share more details on our quarterly and fiscal year financial results, starting with revenue. Fourth
quarter recurring revenue was $351 million, down 6% year-over-year as reported, and down 4% year-over-year in
constant currency.
The year-over-year growth rate was negatively impacted by 3 points from upfront revenue. Recurring revenue as
a percentage of total revenue was 86%, up from 81% from the prior year period.
Fourth quarter total revenue was $409 million, down 11% year-over-year as reported, and 9% in constant
currency. For the full year, recurring revenue exceeded the high end of our outlook range at $1.479 billion, a
decrease of 1% as reported, and an increase of 1% in constant currency.
Total revenue was also within our outlook range at $1.750 billion, down 5% as reported, and 3% in constant
currency.
Moving to profitability and free cash flow. Total gross margin for the quarter was 60.9%, down 100 basis points
year-over-year. Operating margin was 17.6%, down 190 basis points year-over-year.
Both gross margin and operating margin year-over-year changes were primarily driven by the upfront revenue
impact. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.53 exceeding the top end of our guidance range.
We generated $148 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which is a $79 million increase sequentially and a $20
million decrease on a year-over-year basis.
In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately $29 million or approximately 1 million shares. For the full
year, we repurchased $215 million or 5.8 million shares.
Before I provide our annual financial outlook for 2025, I'd like to provide some additional context. In line with
historical seasonality, Q1 is our largest renewal, highest erosion and lowest growth quarter.
As such, we expect both total and cloud ARR to decline sequentially in Q1 and anticipate a significant weighting
of growth to the second half of 2025.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 11-Feb-2025
In the first half, we expect the growth rate for total ARR to be below our guidance range and cloud ARR to be at
the low end of our range before both accelerating in the second half. We expect to return to total ARR growth in
the fourth quarter.
Our 2024 total ARR growth rate is the primary driver for our 2025 recurring revenue outlook. We anticipate a 1%
headwind in 2025 related to upfront recurring revenue.
With respect to total revenue, we anticipate consulting revenue will decline in the high single digit range on a
constant currency basis.
Using the currency rates at the end of December 2024, we anticipate a negative currency impact year-over-year
of 150 to 200 basis points to our 2025 revenue outlook.
Compared to three months ago, the currency exchange rate movement created an approximately $20 million
headwind on 2025 operating income.
On total gross margin, we expect approximately 100 basis points decline due to currency and cloud mix, partially
offset by cloud rate improvement.
Regarding expenses, we remain on track with our previously announced cost actions. On operating margin, we
expect to maintain our 2024 rate as we benefit from last year's cost actions and continue to optimize expenses
across the company, while continuing to prioritize key investments.
Regarding free cash flow, our fiscal year free cash flow is being impacted by FX headwinds and total ARR exit
rate in 2024.
These items have negatively impacted our free cash flow by approximately $25 million since last quarter. We
anticipate Q1 free cash flow to be slightly negative due to the lower Q4 2024 bookings and 2025 ARR linearity.
Our annual outlook for 2025, which is on a constant currency basis for ARR and revenue, is as follows. Cloud
ARR is anticipated to grow year-on-year in the range of 14% to 18%. Total ARR is projected to grow year-on-year
in the range of flat to 2%.
Total recurring revenue is expected to be in the range of minus 3% to minus 5% year-over-year. Total revenue is
anticipated to be in the range of minus 4% to minus 6% year-over-year.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.25. Free cash flow is
anticipated to be in the range of $250 million to $280 million.
Here are some modeling assumptions for 2025. A non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 23%. Weighted average
shares outstanding of 97.4 million. Other expense of approximately $43 million.
On capital allocation, we are pleased with the progress we have made on our share repurchase program to-date.
Our weighted average shares outstanding is at an all-time low. And our balance sheet remains solid.
Our first priority for 2025 is a return to ARR growth. Based on our guidance of revenue decline, which presents a
headwind to free cash flow, we plan to balance growth investments and capital return to shareholders.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 11-Feb-2025
We are targeting a return of over 50% of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases, which
we expect will more than offset dilution and continue to improve our net debt position in 2025.
For the first quarter of 2025, we anticipate recurring revenue to be in the range of minus 4% to minus 6% year-
over-year on a constant currency basis. We expect total revenues to be in the range of minus 6% to minus 8%
year-over-year on a constant currency basis.
We anticipate a negative currency impact year-over-year of approximately 200 basis points. We anticipate non-
GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.59. We project the non-GAAP tax rate to be
approximately 24.3% and the weighted average shares outstanding to be 97.9 million.
As I prepare to transition from my role as CFO, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to our dedicated team,
loyal customers, and our supportive shareholders. It has been an honor to be part of the transformation journey
over the past four years.
Teradata has a strong foundation to build from driven by the strategic initiatives we have set in motion and
continued innovation. The company is well-positioned to return to ARR growth in 2025 and end the year with
cloud ARR approaching 50% of total ARR.
I have no doubt that the upcoming year will bring new opportunities and achievements for the company.
Thank you all for your time today. Now let's open the call for questions.

Chirag Ved Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the new job and Claire congratulations on the new job. It's
been a pleasure partnering with you and your team over the last several quarters.
Steve, maybe first for you. Are you able to comment on how your customers and prospective customers are
thinking about cloud migrations at this point? Cloud growth from the hyperscalers came in a little lower than I think
a lot of investors anticipated. Just wondering if you could double click on what you're seeing internally with data
platforms? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Chirag, yes. Thanks for the question. We did see deal elongation process for Q4 2024 along with, as you pointed
out, some more staged migrations in terms of customers looking at how they balance their on-prem footprint with
their cloud footprint.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 11-Feb-2025
I think, Chirag, that plays into a real opportunity area for us from our hybrid technology capabilities and we are
starting to see the conversations on what their customers change.
For example, even as I look at the portfolio today, we've got around 30 different GenAI POCs in place and
executing today. And these customers are looking at what's the best way to take these into production.
And a number of the different innovations that we delivered in Q4 of 2024 are helping our customers progress
those GenAI projects. But they are balancing that between executing in the cloud and executing it on-prem and
clearly the Teradata technology set being consistent across all of those environments gives us what we believe is
a unique capability in the marketplace.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chirag Ved Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. And Claire, one for you. Can you speak to the factors that give you confidence in the ARR guide, which is
stable and slightly decel in cloud ARR growth, you've seen improved retention rates in the back half of 2024. But
at the same time, cloud ARR has decel-ed. So, would appreciate any clarity you can provide here. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Claire Bramley A
Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. Absolutely, Chirag. And thank you for your kind words as well regarding my transition. It's been a pleasure
on my side, too.
So, just with regard to the cloud ARR guidance that we gave. So, let me give you a little bit of perspective about
how we set the guidance in 2025.
We took a slightly different approach to this time last year in the fact that because we learnt from those trends and
the patterns that we were seeing in 2024, so, the stage migrations that Steve was just talking about, the deal
timing, we factored that in.
And what we've also done is limited the reliance on large eight figure deals. So, we've made sure that the fact that
our guide can be met without those large eight figure deals, obviously once they don't happen, they're very
difficult to replace.
So, little bit of a different approach that gives me confidence from a cloud ARR guidance standpoint.
And as you mentioned, some of the other drivers that we're seeing include an improved retention rate across both
on-premise and total ARR and also some of the changes that we made within the go-to-market organization is
giving us really good visibility in terms of our pipeline, in terms of our erosion, which is significantly improved at
the beginning of the year as well.

Thanks for providing all the incremental color on the growth of 2025. I guess could you give us some finer grain
details on how to help us understand the mix of the pipeline that gives you better confidence, is it more new logos,
expansion? And if there is also any other impacts from Open Table Formats that you're expecting?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Claire Bramley A
Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Yeah, absolutely. So, yes. So first of all, from an expansion migration standpoint, we're anticipating approximately
a 50:50 approach. I think it will be more migrations at the beginning of the year with expansions coming as we
progress throughout the year.
With regards to new logos, we continue to see a good pipeline of new logos, but we still anticipate new logos in
2025 specifically to be a small contributor to our overall growth.
And then I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, some of the innovations that we saw in 2024, again,
we'll start to see the benefits of that as we progress through 2025. And maybe I'll just pass over to Steve to talk a
little bit more about the 2025 innovation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, [ph] YC (00:30:17). Thanks for the question. As we look at the GenAI and AI marketplace, we see
some real opportunity for Teradata to open up a new target addressable market for us in terms of the AI solutions
that we're delivering to our customers.
That's why I highlighted, for example, our Enterprise Vector Store capability, a number of our partners, NVIDIA
and AWS have actually said that our capabilities from an Enterprise Vector Store perspective are unique in the
marketplace.
And taking those capabilities to our customers, enabling them to have real GenAI and AI solutions operating
inside their environment would be a unique differentiation delivered by Teradata. So, we're super excited about
that.
But as we look at the outlook for 2025, we haven't factored in a lot of that new business and new business
opportunity. So, we see that as potential upside as we execute through the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Thanks, Steve. That was actually going to be my next question. So, I'm good here. Thanks.

Erik W. Woodring Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, guys, thanks so much for taking the question. And Claire, I'll echo everyone's comments, we'll greatly miss
you. Good luck with everything.
Steve, if we take a step back, I appreciate the work you and the team have done here. There's been a lot of work,
kind of, across the stack, both from a technology, go-to-market, people, personnel approach, etcetera, but for the
better part of 10 years Teradata has been in a period of transformation.
And I would argue as we look to 2025, it's nice to see some expectations for a bit of growth on the total ARR side.
But recurring revenue is still down, cloud ARR growing, I think, below some expectations.
And so I guess my broad question is just, does there a need to be more kind of divisive action taken to accelerate
this company, turn around and kind of get back to a regular cadence of growth, just as I think about the backdrop
of probably the most prolific AI spending environment that we're going to see in our lifetime.
Just help me understand what needs to get done to move on from transformation to, this is the normal Teradata,
kind of, growing consistently etcetera? And then I have a quick follow-up. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Okay. Thank you. What I would say is, over the last four years, we have pivoted the company considerably.
We've taken the business from essentially a nascent, close to zero dollar cloud business to over $0.5 billion has
been the focus.
That cloud-first focus has really laid the foundation of the turnaround of the company. And having that presence in
the cloud in a high growth marketplace will start to – as that becomes a more and more meaningful part of our
overall ARR picture, contribute more and more dollars from that perspective.
But every company has to continue that transformation journey. And I think we are in the next pivot in terms of
how we address the AI and GenAI opportunity that's in front of us.
And I think some of the capabilities that we delivered in 2024 highlighted by our partnerships with NVIDIA, our
integration with AWS Bedrock, our integrations with Google Gemini and also being native into the Microsoft Fabric
from an AI perspective, really starts to set apart the Teradata technology set and gives us a foundation to build on
in this new AI and GenAI marketplace as we move forward.
What we're doing is continuing to transform our sales capability and sales execution so that they can take those
messages to the marketplace, capture this new TAM for Teradata and utilize technologies either our new AI on-
prem offering that we're looking to release this year or our Enterprise Vector Store, which allows our customers to
manage vectors on an end-to-end basis, is a very new market and a very new sales motion, but we believe will
underpin some very strong growth as we move into the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik W. Woodring Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. I appreciate all that feedback. Thank you, Steve. And then, Claire, you're guiding to free cash flow and EPS
at the midpoint, that's down slightly year-over-year.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 11-Feb-2025
I understand FX has become an incremental headwind, but you've also gone through a period of kind of cost
cutting and cost transformation.
And so can you maybe just help me understand why it might not be paying off as much next year, kind of, the
building blocks to how you get to slight declines in those metrics and especially, if you believe you've embedded
some conservatism in there, just how we should be thinking about that? Thank you so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Claire Bramley A
Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Erik. So, yeah, with regard to both EPS and free cash flow, to your point, I think the two big
headwinds that we see year-over-year, first of all, is the FX impact that I talked about, which is approximately $20
million. So, fairly sizable year-over-year and that did actually materialize in the last three months or so.
The other area, I would say is, naturally, as we finish 2024 with negative ARR, that means a decline in revenue in
2025, so that impacts, from a free cash flow standpoint, obviously, our billing and from a P&L standpoint, our
revenue and profitability.
Now the actions that we took last year are helping us to offset any negative headwinds coming from lower
revenue. They're also helping us to offset any negative impact from our mix, so cloud mix impact.
So, we're definitely offsetting that. What we're not able to offset in our EPS guide is the full impact of the currency.
And the reason that we've not decided to do that is we want to really make sure that we can reinvest some of
these savings back into growth.
As you mentioned, really important for us in 2025 to get total ARR back to growth. So, we want to make sure that
we keep that availability of investment.
Naturally we've got a lot of learnings from 2024. So, we'd like to think that we're being prudent as we set this
guidance. But most of the reason is that we can reinvest some of these savings back to get to total 2025 ARR
growth.

Analyst, Northland Capital Markets
All right. Thank you. So, Claire, you mentioned that you expect ARR and cloud ARR to improve as you go through
calendar 2024. In order for that to happen on a bookings basis over the next two quarters, can you describe what
that trajectory needs to be?
Is it a similar level of acceleration that you're expecting in the back half to drive that or is it going to be significantly
more greater acceleration to drive that overall ARR and cloud ARR acceleration?

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 11-Feb-2025
Yeah. So, it's in line with what we saw in 2024, and in line with, kind of, the historical seasonality. So, as I
mentioned in the prepared remarks, Q1 is always our lowest growth, biggest renewal and highest erosion quarter.
No exception, just for example, in Q1, about 45% of our erosion happened in Q1 for total ARR and about 70% in
H1.
That is what we tend to see historically. So, it is that kind of erosion piece that does drive the linearity trend that
we see. So, it's not necessarily requiring a huge acceleration in additional bookings. It's just the fact that those
erosions tend to drop off in the second half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nehal Chokshi Q
Analyst, Northland Capital Markets
I see. And then can you characterize exactly how much was on-premise erosion in calendar 2024? And what's
your expectation for calendar 2025 in millions of dollars?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Claire Bramley A
Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Yes. We haven't disclosed the exact amount. What I would say, though, as we've mentioned, is that we do see a
meaningful improvement as we exit 2024, so we saw that improvement happen in the fourth quarter of 2024, and
we're expecting that improvement to continue into 2025. We're also very pleased with the visibility that we have
going into the start of the year for 2025 activity.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Swanson Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, thank you. This is Matt Swanson on for Matt. Steve, a little bit earlier, you mentioned 30 different GenAI
proof-of-concepts. And I was just wondering if you could go a little bit deeper into maybe the commonalities
between those, and why they're choosing Teradata. It sounds like maybe it's a little early for those to be driven by
some of the exciting stuff coming in, like the vector store, AI on-prem. But just if there's any sort of common
characteristics that you're seeing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Matt. Yeah, these solutions are actually leveraging technologies which are in
Teradata today. So, for example, bringing language models into the Teradata environment, and actually running
small language models like Hugging Face in the Teradata environment. We see a lot of the solutions that our
customers are looking at, being in the CX space. So taking customer interaction data, it may be very unstructured
data, emails, it may be chat logs, and then utilizing those to essentially make next best action predictions for call
center agents or proactive recommendations to drive different CX solutions.
We've seen a number of different banks in the US look at this technology and the deployment of this technology.
And the reason that they look at Teradata is the long standing fact that Teradata can execute some of the world's
most complicated workloads in the most efficient and effective way. And if you think about that in terms of the
economics of AI, and GenAI, we have a path to enable our customers to deploy GenAI and AI solutions at
enterprise scale in a very cost efficient and cost effective way. And that's why we're really excited with some of
the new language models that are coming out, that are highlighting that requirement that DeepSeek has pointed

to as an example of actually reducing the cost of the enterprise scale of these kind of solutions. So it's great for us
to be able to demonstrate those characteristics to our customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Swanson Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. And then, Claire, I think you mentioned, kind of, the three pieces of return to ARR growth was the go-
to-market changes last year, improved full-year retention rates, and then monetize the innovations in 2024.
They're obviously very interrelated. But is there a way to, kind of, think about how you rank those in terms of
contribution to ARR next year, or how you're kind of thinking about the progression to get to your guidance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Claire Bramley A
Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Yeah, I think, to your point, they're very interrelated. So I think one of the things that we have been working on
over the last 6 or 12 months is that visibility and improvement in our retention rates. So I think that is, as I
mentioned, a big impact in terms of our linearity, and is a big help from a total ARR standpoint in terms of getting
back to growth. So that year-over-year, meaningful improvement I would say is one of the strongest areas.
Obviously, the go-to-market team changes are helping us in terms of improved visibility to that erosion, improved
visibility to our pipeline.
So I wouldn't say that that necessarily is a huge driver of the actual growth, but makes us feel good about the
guidance that we're giving at this point in the year. And then to your point, in terms of innovation, obviously,
anything that we can talk to our customers about with regards to the development of that product and the different
offerings that we give them ultimately is what drives growth. So that, I think, is very interrelated to the other areas.
But obviously is a huge factor in terms us of driving cloud ARR growth at midpoint of 16%, and getting back to
total ARR growth in 2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Great. Thanks, guys. This is Cole on for Derrick. Steve, I'll start with you. Could you just provide us with an update
on open table format? I know you guys have been excited about that as a TAM expander, but just any color on
where customers might be in trying that out with your bring your own query engine capabilities and when we could
see production workloads start to spin up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah, thanks for the question. We see open table format is still a critical capability that we're going to deliver and
continue to improve on in the Teradata platform. One of the key tenets that we have is to be open and connected.
So we want to support both Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake, that really opens up massive swaths of data inside
our customer organization. And then thinking about the Teradata query engine and the analytical capabilities that
we have within that engine, the new AI capabilities that we're bringing to bear and putting those against these
massive volumes of open table format data that we expect to become more and more common inside our
customer environments is absolutely essential and critical for us. And our product roadmap continues to deliver
new capabilities there to support our customers' execution. We are seeing it as early days, although every single
customer, I think is talking to us about open table format.

And it's really very interesting to see customers think about their data workloads and data execution, both from an
enterprise data warehouse perspective where they need a really performance storage layer. But then a lake
environment where critical performance may not be that important, but they still want to bring some fantastic
analytical, or GenAI, or AI capabilities into that data to make it meaningful for them. And that's really what our
strategy is and from an execution perspective. And I think the proof-of-concepts that we're seeing, that we're
executing in terms of taking even some of the unstructured data on a different topic to OTFs, and making that real
and analyzable for our customers is super interesting.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Great. Very helpful. And then, Claire, one for you. The cloud NRR number downticked again, you've talked about
better retention across on-prem in total that you've been seeing the last couple of months. But can you just give
us a sense of, in the medium term, the shape of that cloud NRR, and when we could maybe think about potential
reacceleration there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Claire Bramley A
Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Absolutely. So first of all, just to mention that 2024 net expansion rate did finish in line with what we were
expecting. So that was good, so, no surprises there. As we look out to 2025, linked to some of the comments that
I've already made, in the sense of, we anticipate the, kind of, the first half of the year to see the impact of the
churn and erosion and more migrations. And the second half of the year to be more weighted in expansion. Our
net expansion rate with regards to cloud will reflect that as well. So it'll decelerate before it then re-accelerates
over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raimo Lenschow Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Perfect. Thank you. And Claire, we will miss you, first of all, let's start with that. And a more fundamental question
to start. If you think about the open table format, obviously there's a big discussion, but obviously you guys come
out of the structured world. How do you see that relationship evolving between open table format, which is kind of,
not dumping, but like having everything in one massive data lake versus, kind of, the more structured data, kind
of, data warehousing that you guys grew up with. Like, how do you think that relationship will grow out over time?
And how is that, how your – how do you think you can play this? And maybe play this differently? And then I had
one follow-up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. Hi, Raimo. Thank you for the questions. Yeah, we see open table format as a fantastic opportunity to make
those more performant, and to take all the benefits of Teradata technology and our massive parallel computing
architectures to make OTF environment more performant even with large swaths of data which has always been
Teradata's core business. How to get the best out of massive volumes of data even in an EDW construct. But one
of the things that AI and GenAI world needs as a really enterprise scale vector store capability. And that is
something that we already have inside the Teradata technology set in terms of being able to store vectors.

Q4 2024 Earnings Call 11-Feb-2025
So taking that OTF data or taking unstructured data, doing vector analysis against that in conjunction with
language models, and taking and managing the massive numbers of vectors largely enable organizations to get
the best out of data no matter where it's stored, whether it's in OTF or whether it's in unstructured data. And no,
we're just looking at the amount of data that's stored in unstructured files as an example and by putting Teradata's
Enterprise Vector Store next to those files, you can actually get meaningful results, and meaningful insights into
the world's most unstructured data, which by far and away outnumbers the structured data pools that we have in
the world today. So exciting times ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raimo Lenschow Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah. And then, Claire, one for you like, obviously we're kind of looking at the, kind of the lead – we're trying to
look at leading indicators. If you think about like can you talk a little bit about some of the dynamics like billings
this quarter, probably quarter-after-quarter like, to us, they came on more on the weaker side. Is there some one-
off stuff that we, kind of, need to be aware of? And you might have answered that earlier in the call, I apologize, if
you've kind of discussed it already.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Claire Bramley A
Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Yeah, I think, Raimo, what you're looking for is, kind of, some linearity narrative. So, what I said in my prepared
remarks was that we anticipate our cloud ARR to be the low end of the range that I gave for the full year. So just
to give you a view on that and then from a total ARR standpoint, because of the erosion activity that happens in
the first half of the year, as previously mentioned. The total ARR will actually be below at the low end of the full
year range that I gave. So just cloud ARR at the low end and total ARR below. I also did give some guidance on
our recurring revenue and total revenue in Q1. So that, I mean, as you would expect, recurring revenue in Q1 is
closely following our exit of total ARR. So we're giving a range in constant currency of minus 4% to minus 6% for
recurring, and minus 6% to minus 8% total revenue. Hopefully, that helps in terms of some linearity with our
modeling.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call
back over to Steve McMillan for his final remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We're building on that foundation that we built in 2024, and we're really
excited about the capabilities in delivering AI and GenAI solutions for our customers. We know that we've got the
trusted hybrid AI platform at enterprise scale that the world's leading organizations really need right now, and
we're going to continue to innovate and deliver capabilities which can expand our TAM, whilst also empowering
our customers with the analytics they need today. We look forward to returning Teradata to growth in 2025. Thank
you very much.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Second Quarter
2025 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the
presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded.
And for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dave
Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Fildes
Vice President, Investor Relations, Amazon.com, Inc.
Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2025 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is
Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you
to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary
on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the
comparable period of 2024.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 31, 2025, only and
will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors
that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC,
including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying
this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional

disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable
GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate
assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, tariff and trade
policies and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates,
regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud
services and new and emerging technologies and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions,
restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and
therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Andy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $167.7 billion in revenue, up 12% year-over-year, excluding the impact
from foreign exchange rates. Operating income was $19.2 billion, up 31% year-over-year and trailing 12-month
free cash flow was $18.2 billion. We saw good progress across our various customer experiences and businesses
this past quarter.
Starting with stores. We feel good about both the inputs and outputs of the business. At Amazon, we think of our
business in terms of inputs and outputs. Outputs are metrics like revenue or operating margin. But of course, you
can't manage at the output level, it's the inputs that drive the outputs. So, we spend virtually all of our time
internally talking about and [ph] goaling (00:03:09) against inputs.
The inputs that matter most to customers in our stores business are selection, low prices and speed of delivery.
We've taken another step forward in selection these past few months headlined by the much requested return of
Nike's products to Amazon's retail store.
We've added premium brands like Away, Aveda, Marc Jacobs fragrances and brands from Saks in Amazon like
Dolce&Gabbana, Etro, Stella McCartney, Rosetta Getty and La Prairie. And we started expanding our very
successful Perishables Pilot, where we offer customers perishables as a point of purchase when they're ordering
other items that will be delivered same day from our same-day fulfillment nodes.
We're seeing strong customer adoption as 75% of customers who have used this service this year are first-time
shoppers for perishables on Amazon, with 20% of customers who used the service returning multiple times within
their first month.
Our prices continue to be low and sharp for customers. It's one of the reasons our Everyday Essentials growth
outpaced the rest of the business globally and representing one out of every three units sold.
It's also why well-known research firm Futurum has concluded for eight years in a row that Amazon has the
lowest prices of any US retailer, but perhaps the clearest outputs are the rate at which our stores business grew
this past quarter and the success we saw in our recent Prime Day event.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2025
This year's Prime Day was our biggest ever with record sales, number of items sold and number of prime sign-
ups in the 3 weeks leading up to the Prime Day. Customers save billions of dollars, and independent sellers, most
of which are small and medium-sized businesses, saw their best sales performance of any Prime Day event yet.
There continues to be a lot of noise about the impact that tariffs will have on retail prices and consumption. Much
of it thus far has been wrong and misreported. As we said before, it's impossible to know what will happen.
Where will tariffs finally settle especially China? What happens when we deplete the inventory we forward bought
or that our selling partners forward deployed in advance of the tariffs going into effect.
If costs end up being higher, who will absorb them, but what we can share is what we've seen thus far, which is
that through the first half of the year, we haven't yet seen diminishing demand nor price is meaningfully
appreciating.
We also have such diversity of sellers in our marketplace, over 2 million sellers in total with differing strategies of
whether to pass on higher cost to consumers, the customers are advantaged shopping at Amazon because
they're more likely to find lower prices on the items they care about.
Further improving delivery speed remains a key focus, and we continue to make progress. We've previously
shared how we re-architect our US inbound network into a regional structure, allowing us to place inventory and
ship from locations closer to customers, improving speed and lowering costs. That work is delivering tangible
results.
In Q2, we increased the share of orders moving through direct lanes where packages go straight from fulfillment
to delivery without extra stops by over 40% year-over-year.
We've also reduced the average distance packages travel by 12% and lowered handling touches per unit by
nearly 15%. We've made progress on order consolidation. With more products positioned locally, we're able to
pack more items into each box and send fewer packages per order.
That has helped drive higher units per box and improved overall cost to serve. Taken together, these
improvements are making the network faster and structurally more efficient. We've also set another global speed
record in Q2 delivering to prime members at our fastest speeds ever.
In the US, we delivered 30% more items same day or next day than during the same period last year. Items
customers used to pick up locally in nearby physical stores are now arriving at their door often within hours. And
we're working to further improve delivery speeds no matter where customers live. We've recently announced
plans to expand our same-day and next-day delivery to tens of millions of US customers in more than 4,000
smaller cities, towns and rural communities by the end of the year.
Today, it's already available in more than 1,000 of these communities across the US. The early response from
customers in these areas have been very positive. They're shopping more frequently and purchasing household
essentials in meaningfully higher rates.
Automation and robotics are also important contributors to improving cost efficiencies and driving better customer
experiences over time. We deployed our one millionth robot across our global fulfillment network and unveiled
innovations in our last-mile innovation center, such as automated package sorting and a transformative
technology that brings packages directly to employees in an ergonomic height.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2025
We rolled out DeepFleet, our [indiscernible] (00:08:04) robot travel efficiency by 10%. At our scale, that's a big
deal. DeepFleet acts like a traffic management system to coordinate robots' movements to find optimal paths and
reduce bottlenecks. For customers, it means faster delivery times and lower costs; for our team members, our
robots handle more of the physically demanding tasks, making our operations network even safer.
This combination of robotics and generative AI is just getting started. And while we've made significant progress,
it's still early with respect to what will roll out in the next few years.
Moving on to Amazon Ads. We're pleased with the strong growth, generating $15.7 billion of revenue in the
quarter, growing 22% year-over-year. We continue to see strength across our broad portfolio of full funnel
advertising offerings that in the US alone help advertisers reach an average ad-supported audience of more than
300 million across our own properties.
These are properties like our retail marketplace, Prime Video, Twitch and Fire TV; in live sports, such as NFL,
NASCAR and the NBA, as well as third-party websites and apps.
Another area we're excited about is our demand side platform, or Amazon DSP. Our DSP enables advertisers to
plan, activate and measure full funnel investments. Our trillions of proprietary browsing, shopping and streaming
signals paired with extensive supply side relationships and our secure clean rooms provide advertisers the ability
to optimize advertising, deliver greater precision and drive efficient and effective advertising outcomes.
And in June, we announced a momentous partnership with Roku, giving advertisers access to 80 million
connected TV households, the largest authenticated connected TV footprint in the US exclusively through
Amazon DSP. It's a giant leap forward for advertisers bringing best-in-class planning, audience precision and
performance to TV advertising.
We also announced an integration between Disney's Real-Time Ad Exchange and Amazon DSP. This
collaboration allows advertisers to gain direct access to Disney's premium inventory across platforms like
Disney+, ESPN and Hulu while allowing them to leverage insights from both companies.
When advertisers work with Amazon, they're not just buying ad space, they're benefiting from exceptional
programming, innovative technology and unrivaled signals, measurement and audience development that provide
strong relevancy for consumers and return on investment for brands.
Moving on to AWS. In Q2, AWS grew 17.5% year-over-year and now has over $123 billion annualized revenue
run rate. We continue to help organizations of all sizes accelerate their transition to the cloud, signing new
agreements with companies, including PepsiCo, Airbnb, Peloton, Nasdaq, London Stock Exchange, Nissan
Motor, GitLab, SAP, Warner Bros. Discovery, TwelveLabs, FICO, Iberia Airlines, SK Telecom and NatWest.
In the rapidly evolving world of generative AI, AWS continues to build a large, fast-growing triple-digit year-over-
year percentage multibillion-dollar business with more demand than we have supply for at the moment.
A few points to make. First, on the hardware side, our custom AI chip, Trainium2 is landing capacity in larger
quantities and has impressively emerged as the backbone for Anthropic's newest generation Claude models and
many of our most essential offerings like Amazon Bedrock.

We've also launched Amazon EC2 instances powered by NVIDIA Grace Blackwell Superchips, AWS' most
powerful NVIDIA GPU accelerated instance.
Second, in Bedrock, we've recently added Anthropic's Claude 4 and is the fastest‑growing model ever in Bedrock.
We've also continued to see strong adoption of Amazon Nova, our own Frontier model, and it's now the second
most popular foundation model in Bedrock.
New features in Nova allow customers to customize their Nova models in ways they can't in other foundation
models, allowing organizations to infuse these models with their unique expertise while optimizing for cost and
speed.
As people have become excited about building agents, they're realizing they lack the tools to build them. In May,
we released Strands, an open source way to more easily build agents, which has taken off with a wide range of
customers, with already 2,500 stars on GitHub and over 300,000 downloads on Pi.
Customers are also struggling with deploying agents into production in a secure and scalable way. It's holding up
enterprises scaling agents. To help solve that problem, Bedrock just released AgentCore.
AgentCore is a set of building blocks that gives customers the industry's first secure serverless runtime to provide
both synchronous and asynchronous execution, agent identity and boundaries, a memory service, a gateway to
translate services to MCP‑compatible interfaces, built‑in code execution and web‑browser tools, and an
observability service. Customers are excited about AgentCore, and it frees them up to start deploying agents
more expansively.
Third, you're starting to see AWS release more powerful applications at the top layer of the AI stack. AWS
Transform is an AWS Agent that dramatically reduces mainframe modernization timelines from years to months,
completes VMware TC2 conversions up to 80 times faster, it makes it simple to move from .NET Windows to
.NET Linux implementations, reducing licensing cost for .NET applications by up to 40%.
We've also just released Kiro, our new Agentic integrated development environment coding agent. There's a lot of
buzz around Kiro, with several hundred thousand developers using or requesting access in the first couple weeks,
100,000 used in the first five days of the preview.
What struck a chord for developers is that Kiro allows them to do Vibe coding, where developers use natural
language to chat with a coding agent to build code. But unlike other coding agents, where developers don't really
have any structure to build on top of, Kiro allows developers to use natural language to build a spec, and then
automatically updates that spec as they continue to vibe code or interact with Kiro.
This makes it much easier to go from prototyping to production. Customers also like Kiro's event‑driven agent
hooks that act like an experienced developer catching things developers might miss. When developers save a
React component, hooks update the test file. When they modify API endpoints, hooks refresh ReadMe files, when
they're ready to commit, security hooks scan for leak credentials.
It's still very early for Kiro, but it seems clear we're on to something customers love, and Kiro has a chance to
transform how developers build software. I say this frequently, but remember that 85% to 90% of worldwide IT
spend is still on‑premises versus in the cloud. In the next 10 to 15 years, that equation is going to flip, further
accelerated by companies' excitement for leveraging AI.

So AWS has significantly broader functionality, stronger security, and operational performance, a much deeper
experience helping enterprises modernize their infrastructure, bodes well for the AWS business moving forward.
We're also seeing momentum in a number of our other areas across Amazon.
I'll mention just a few. We're excited about our progress with Alexa+, our next‑generation assistant powered by
generative AI. We've been rolling out early access to US customers to start, millions of customers have access
now. We're seeing very positive feedback, and we'll continue to iterate on the experience.
We've recently completed our third successful launch of Project Kuiper. We haven't launched this service
commercially yet but already have an impressive amount of enterprise and government customers who have
signed agreements to use Kuiper.
In Prime Video live sports, our first season of NASCAR drew about 2 million viewers per race and the youngest
audience among NASCAR broadcasters in more than a decade. We've recently announced our stellar
broadcasting crew for our upcoming first NBA season, including Ian Eagle, Stan Van Gundy, Kevin Harlan,
Dwyane Wade, Taylor Rooks, Blake Griffin, Dirk Nowitzki, Steve Nash, and Candace Parker.
We also announced Denis Villeneuve, an Academy Award nominee, as the Director for the next James Bond film,
James Bond is in the hands of one of today's greatest filmmakers, and we cannot wait to get started on 007's next
adventure.
Finally, we continue to be very pleased with the growth and residence of Amazon Pharmacy and it's grown 50%
year-over-year, year-to-date on an already significant size base. A lot of good things happening across the
company.
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Olsavsky
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Amazon.com, Inc.
Thanks, Andy. Let's start with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $167.7 billion, a 12% increase
year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Foreign exchange had a $1.5 billion favorable impact to
revenue in the quarter, as foreign currencies generally strengthened versus the US dollar.
As a reminder, our Q2 revenue guidance had anticipated an unfavorable impact of approximately 10 basis points
or $100 million. Worldwide operating income was $19.2 billion, which was $1.7 billion above the high end of our
guidance range.
Across our segments, we continue to prioritize cost-effective innovation that delivers value for our customers. In
the North America segment, second quarter revenue was $100.1 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year.
International segment revenue was $36.8 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year, excluding the impact of
foreign exchange. Worldwide paid units grew 12% year-over-year. We remain focused on inputs that matter most
to our customers.
In the second quarter, we saw broad-based strength across our key performance metrics. This includes sharp
pricing and more in stock availability as well as record delivery speeds for Prime members. Our millions of global
sellers continue to be an important contributor to our vast selection. This helps customers find the items they need
and does so at a competitive price. Our investment in tools, services and fast delivery speeds help our selling
partners reach more customers and further scale their businesses.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2025
In Q2, worldwide third-party seller unit mix was 62%, the highest ever, up 100 basis points from Q2 of last year.
We're also closely monitoring the macroeconomic environment, including the impact of tariffs. As Andy
mentioned, our Q2 plan factored in a range of assumptions, not all of which materialized. We will continue to
consider a range of assumptions going forward.
Shifting to profitability. North America segment operating income was $7.5 billion, an increase of $2.5 billion year-
on-year. North America operating margin was 7.5%, up 190 basis points year-over-year. International segment
operating income was $1.5 billion, up $1.2 billion year-over-year. International operating margin was 4.1%, up 320
basis points year-over-year. We're pleased with the strong execution of our operations teams and the positive
experience they delivered for customers.
In Q2, we saw productivity gains in our transportation network, driven by improved inventory placement, strong
leverage on high-unit volumes, and higher levels of in-demand inventory from both first-party and third-party
selling partners.
These factors contributed to faster delivery speeds and lower costs. Outbound shipping costs were up 6% year-
over-year, and continued to grow at a meaningfully slower pace than unit growth, which, as I mentioned earlier,
was up 12% year-over-year.
We're committed to initiatives that further improve our cost structure. Strategic inventory placement drives multiple
benefits, including better in-stock availability, shorter delivery routes, and faster customer delivery times. When
we optimize inventory location, we can consolidate more items for package reducing packaging materials and
costs.
To achieve this, we will continue to improve upon on inbound network, expand our US Same-Day Delivery
facilities, including in rural communities, and implement robotics and automation across our facilities. While year-
over-year improvements in operating margin may fluctuate, we have a purposeful strategy to achieve sustained
progress over time.
Shifting to advertising, advertising revenue grew 22% year-over-year, driven by sponsored products as we saw
strong traffic in our stores. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North American and
International segments. Our full funnel advertising approach of connecting brands with customers is resonating.
Moving next to our AWS segment, revenue was $30.9 billion, an increase of 17.5% year-over-year. AWS now has
an annualized revenue run rate of more than $123 billion.
During the second quarter, we continue to see growth in both our generative AI and non-generative AI
businesses, as companies turn their attention to newer initiatives, bring more workloads to the cloud, restart or
accelerate existing migrations from on-premise to the cloud, and tap into the power of generative AI.
AWS operating income was $10.2 billion. We did see AWS segment margins decline from a record high of 39.5%
in Q1 to 32.9% in Q2. The largest quarter-over-quarter driver of the decrease, or about half, is due to the
seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense driven by the timing of our annual compensation cycle.
AWS margins also saw headwinds from higher depreciation expense as well as unfavorable impacts from year-
over-year fluctuations in foreign-exchange rates. The depreciation expense is a result of our growing investments
in capital expenditures in AWS.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2025
As we've said in the past, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of
investments we are making at any point in time. We will continue to invest more capital in chips, data centers, and
power to pursue this unusually large opportunity that we have in generative AI.
Now turning to our cash CapEx, which was $31.4 billion in Q2. We expect Q2 CapEx to be reasonably
representative of our quarterly capital investment rate for the back half of this year.
AWS continues to be the primary driver, as we invest to support demand for our AI services and increasingly in
custom silicon, like Trainium, as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and International
segments.
Additionally, we continue to invest in our fulfillment and transportation network to support growth of the business,
improve delivery speeds and lower our cost to serve by investing in Same-Day Delivery facilities as well as
robotics and automation. Collectively, these investments will support growth for many years to come.
Moving on to our third quarter financial guidance. As a reminder, our guidance considers a range of possibilities,
which take into consideration Q2 results, trends we see quarter-to-date and expectations around the
macroeconomic environment, including tariffs. Q3 net sales are expected to be between $174 billion and $179.5
billion.
We estimate the year-over-year impact of changes in foreign exchange rates based on current rates, which we
expect to be a favorable impact of approximately 130 basis points.
As a reminder, global currencies can fluctuate during the quarter. Q3 operating income is expected to be between
$15.5 billion and $20.5 billion. In this dynamic environment, we'll focus on what matters most, delivering
exceptional customer value through product selection, competitive prices and unmatched convenience.
We remain focused on driving a better customer experience and believe putting customers first is the only reliable
way to create lasting value for our shareholders.
With that, let's move on to your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
Our first question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Doug Anmuth Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks so much for taking the questions. I have two. First, can you just help us understand with some more
granularity how tariffs are being absorbed across suppliers, Amazon and consumers and whether you anticipate
any change going forward?
And then second on AWS, we're seeing significantly faster cloud growth among the number two and number
three players in the space. I totally appreciate that AWS is coming off of a bigger base. But beyond that, do you
think the output gap is due more to customer demand or infrastructure supply or both? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
Yes. I'll take both of those. I'll start with the tariffs. I think what we said a number of times, and we still believe it is,
we just don't know what's going to happen moving forward. It's hard to know where the tariffs are going to settle,
particularly in China. It's hard to know what will happen when we deplete some of the prebuys that we did on our
own first-party retail and then some of the forward deploying that we saw of our third-party selling partners.
And when – if costs go up over time, it's – we're unsure at this point who's going to end up absorbing those higher
costs. What we can tell you is what we've seen so far in the first half of the year, in the first half, we just haven't
seen diminished demand. And we haven't seen any kind of broad scale ASP increases. So that could change in
the second half. There are a lot of things that we don't know, but that's what we've seen so far.
On the question on AWS, the first thing I'd say is it's – as you said, Doug, in your question, year-over-year
percentages and growth rates are always a function of the base in which you operate. And we have a
meaningfully larger business in the AWS segment than others. I think the second player is about 65% of the size
of AWS.
And we – when we look at the results over the last number of quarters, there are sometimes where, as far as we
can tell, we're growing faster than others and sometimes others are growing faster than us. But it's still, if you look
at second-place player you're talking about, it's still a pretty significant segment, market-segment leadership
position that we have. And regardless, these are all really just moments in time.
The last week is a moment in time too, where the reality of what really matters is what customers' experiences are
in operating on these platforms. And if you look at what matters to customers, what they care – they care a lot
about what the operational performance is, what the availability is, what the durability is, what the latency and
throughput is of the various services.
And I think we have a pretty significant advantage in that area. They care a lot about security, if you have data
that matters and for most companies, they're putting data that they really care about in the cloud. The security and
the privacy of that data matters a lot, and there are very different results in security in AWS than you'll see in other
players.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2025
And yes, you could just look at what's happened the last couple months, you can just see kind of adventures at
some of these players almost every month. And so, very big difference, I think, in security. And then I think a
really significant difference in functionality, where not just in the core infrastructure do we have a lot more
functionality in our services, but I think if you look at our end-to-end offering in AWS – in AI, it's from the bottom of
the stack all the way to the top, it's pretty different. So I feel good about the inputs and the services that we're
offering to customers across AI as well as non-AI, and we have more demand than we have capacity right now.
So we could be doing more revenue and helping customers more, and we're working very hard on changing that
outcome and how much capacity we have but it's still – like if you look at the business, it's a $123 billion annual-
revenue-run-rate business and it's still early.
I mean, how often do you have an opportunity that's a $123 billion of annual revenue run rate where you say it's
still early? It's a very unusual opportunity that we're very bullish about.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Please proceed with your
question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Mahaney Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. I'll stick with AWS to start with. Could you just disclose the backlog number? And then in the past, I know
you've talked about the supply constraints and hoping that they will sort of resolve themselves by the back half of
the year. Is that still your intention, anything that suggests that the supply constraints are going to get resolved
earlier or later?
And then a long-term question on Alexa+ and I've been experimenting with it for a while. Just Andy, when you
think about the potential that that has in terms of increasing engagement, maybe tapping into some services
revenue, advertising, maybe a little bit more retail sales per household, you're just reducing friction. Just talk
about what – from a financial perspective, how you think that could play out, how we would maybe see that in the
numbers. Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Fildes A
Vice President, Investor Relations, Amazon.com, Inc.
Hey, Mark. This is Dave. I'll just start off to give you the backlog figures. So at the end of quarter, at June 30, that
was $195 billion, so that's up about 25% year-over-year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
On the supply constraints as it relates to AWS and what we see there, as I mentioned, we have more demand
than we have capacity at this point. And I think that – and you see some of the constraints and they kind of exist
in multiple places. The single biggest constraint is power. But you also see constraints off and on with chips and
then some of the components that once you have the chips to actually make the servers, sometimes you have
new generations of chips that are a little bit later than they're supposed to be and sometimes you get the chips
and the yield you get in making servers isn't what you expect when you get to ramp.
So there are a bunch of those pieces today that we're working on. It's really true across the industry today. I don't
believe that we will have fully resolved the amount of capacity we need for the amount of demand that we have in

a couple of quarters. I think it will take several quarters. But I do expect that it's going to get better each quarter,
and I'm optimistic about that.
I think on the Alexa question, I think I'd start by saying the Alexa+ experience is so much better than I think our
prior Alexa experience. She's much more intelligent than her prior self. She's much more capable and I would say
unlike the other chatbots that are out there today who are good at answering questions, but really can't take any
action for you. Alexa+ can take a lot of action for you, which is very compelling.
So I can ask Alexa to play music for me or play video for me, to move my music from one device to another or if
I'm listening to a song that's on – that's in a movie, I can ask Alexa+ to actually put that movie scene on of the
song I'm playing, and it will put it on my Prime Video Fire TV. Or if I have guests coming over, I can say, Alexa
draw the curtains, put the light on the porch and the driveway, increase the temperature by 5 degrees and put on
music that would be great for a dinner party. And she does all that just through using natural language.
So she could take a lot of actions and it's compelling. And what we see so far, we've been rolling out Alexa+
starting in the US. It's with millions of customers now. The rest in the US coming in the next couple months and
it's starting the international rollout more broadly later in the year. And customers really like the experience. They
recognize how much better it is than what it was before. The ratings are very high. The usage is much more
expansive than what they were using before and the number of calls they're making is meaningfully higher.
And I think there are a number of different areas where we'll see benefit. I think first if you build the world's best
personal assistant, that has a lot of utility for customers, and therefore, it gets used a lot. So it means everything
from people are excited about the devices that they can buy from us that has Alexa+ enabled in it. People do a lot
of shopping and it's really – it's a delightful shopping experience that will keep getting better. I think over time,
there will be opportunities as people are engaging more multiturn conversations to have advertising play a role to
help people find discovery and also as a lever to drive revenue.
And I think over time, you could also imagine, as we keep adding functionality that there could be some sort of
subscription element beyond what there is today. Today, Prime members get Alexa+ for free and non-Prime
members pay $19.99 a month for Alexa+. So I think it's very – it's still very early days, but we're very encouraged
by the experience we're providing and you can bet we're going to be iterating on it constantly.

Colin Alan Sebastian Q
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first off, with respect to the International segment and the progress in
both revenues and margins. I was hoping you could add maybe some color on the drivers of each of those and
the sustainability of the improved efficiency in those markets.
And then, Andy, you mentioned Kuiper. We haven't heard as much about that of late. So maybe if you could
review where things stand relative to next year's launch target, timing of the service rollout and maybe any
perspective you have on the longer-term ambitions for the satellite network? Thank you.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2025
Thanks Colin, this is Brian. I'll start with the International segment question. So, yeah, a very strong quarter for
International segment both on revenue growth and also on operating margin.
Operating margin was up 320 basis points year-over-year to 4.1%. And if you look, that's the continuation of a
strong progression we've seen quarter-by-quarter over the last 10 quarters in total, we've seen an increase of
close to 700 basis points during that time period.
So really, it's a tale of two pieces of two segments – or excuse me, sections within International. One is the
established countries like UK, Germany and Japan, already at similar margin profiles to the US. So we'll – as they
continue to grow, their contribution of profit will grow over time, and that's what we're seeing.
In the quarter, we saw strong productivity in our transportation network in those countries, much like we saw in
the US, and that's led to higher units for package and faster delivery speeds at lower cost.
So again, the theme of lower cost to serve and also increased speed and better selection for our customers
continues to grow internationally as well. In our emerging countries, we're pleased with the progress we're making
there.
We've launched eight countries, of course, in the last five years. And they are all varying degrees of upfront
investment in different point in times in their journey to profitability, but they're all making very nice improvements
quarter-over-quarter in growing selection, adding Prime members and expanding our customer offerings.
So I think what you're saying, again, is sustained improvement in those areas. I feel very good about it. The
established countries are continuing to grow and develop and very much look like the United States and the
emerging countries, again, are all very different stages of growth right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
On the Project Kuiper question, so Project Kuiper is our low earth orbit satellite constellation that we're putting up
and launching and there's 400 million to 500 million households worldwide who don't have broadband
connectivity.
And it means they can't do a lot of things we take for granted, like education online or business online or shopping
or entertainment. There is really a digital divide, and it's much needed.
And it's also true for enterprises and for governments that they have assets or needs to have visibility or
connectivity that they can't get today given the lack of broadband in a bunch of places around the world. So
there's a high need.
I would say that as we get our constellation into space, there will really be two players that have what I would
consider the modern technology in low earth orbit satellite. One is the incumbent in the market today and the
second will be Project Kuiper. I think that we will have a pretty meaningful differentiation here in performance.
If you look at the performance of what I expect on the uplink and downlink, I think Project Kuiper will be
advantaged. I also think the pricing is going to be very compelling for customers. And then I think if you think
about the three key customer segments who want low earth orbit satellite: consumers, enterprises and
governments.

We have very strong relationships with all three customer segments given our consumer businesses and our
AWS business, and I think if you think about enterprises and governments, a lot of what they want to do when
they take the data down from space is they actually want to put it into a cloud to do analysis, analytics and AI and
various operations on top of it.
And the fact that Project Kuiper and AWS are so seamlessly connected is very attractive to enterprises and to
governments. And I'm kind of amazed, we haven't launched Project Kuiper yet. But the number of enterprise and
government agreements that have been signed already to use Project Kuiper is impressive.
So we're working very hard to get the satellites into space. We have some delays with some of the rocket
providers, but we have most of the available rocket launches over the next couple years and were very helpful to
get the service into commercial beta later this year or early next year.

Brian Nowak Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. Andy, I have two for you on AWS. They're a little tough, but I'm going to throw
that at you. So there is a Wall Street finance person narrative right now that AWS is falling behind in Gen AI with
concerns about share loss to peers, et cetera.
Can you just sort of address that? What is your rebuttal to that? And talk to us about your and the team's most
important focal points. Just to ensure that AWS stays on the nice edge of innovation versus hyperscaler peers?
And then secondly, I know AWS is a big business. But is there any reason to assume it shouldn't accelerate in the
back half and into 2026 given the size of the opportunity and all of the Gen AI capabilities that are going to sort of
come to us in the next 12 months?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah. So on the first one around AI, the first thing I would say is that I think it is so early right now in AI. If you look
at what's really happening in the space, you have – it's very top heavy. So you have a small number of very large
frontier models that are being trained that spend a lot on computing, a couple of which are being are being trained
on top of AWS and others are being trained elsewhere.
And then you also have, I would say, a relatively small number of very large-scale generative AI applications. The
one category would be Chatbots with the largest by a fair bit being ChatGPT, but the other category being really,
I'll call it, coding agents. So these are companies like Cursor, Vercel, Lovable and some of the companies like
that. Again, several of which run significant chunks on top of AWS.
And then you've got a very large number of generative AI applications that are in pilot mode – or they're in pilots
or that are being developed as we speak and a very substantial number of agents that also people are starting to
try to build and figure out how to get into production in a broad way, but they're all – they're quite early.
And many of them that are out there are, they're significant, but they're just smaller in terms of usage relative to
some of those top heavy applications I mentioned earlier. We have a very significant number of enterprises and

startups who are running applications on top of AWS' AI services. And then – but they're all – again, like the
amount of usage and the expansiveness of the use cases and how much people are putting them into production
and the number of agents that are going to exist, it's still just earlier stage than it's going to be.
And so then when you think about what's going to matter in AI, what's going to – what are customers going to
care about when they're thinking about what infrastructure use, I think you kind of have to look at the different
layers of the stack.
And I think for those that are both building models, but also just if you look at where the real costs are, they're
going to ultimately be an inference, today so much of the cost in training because customers are really training
their models and trying to figure out to get their applications into production.
But at scale, 80% to 90% of the cost will be in inference, because you only train periodically, but you're spitting
out predictions and inferences all the time. And so what they're going to care a lot about is they're going to care
about the compute and the hardware they're using.
And we have a very deep partnership with NVIDIA and will for as long as I can foresee, but we saw this movie in
the CPU space with Intel, where customers are hankering for better price performance.
And so we built just like in the CPU space, where we built our own custom silicon and building Graviton which is
about 40% more price performance than the other leading x86 processors.
We've done the same thing on the custom silicon side in AI with Trainium and our second version of Trainium2 is
really – it's become the backbone of Anthropic's next Claude models they're training on top of, and it's become
the backbone of Bedrock and the inference that we do.
So I think a lot of the inference, it's about 30% and 40% better price performance than the other GPU providers
out there right now, and we're already working on our third version of Trainium as well.
So, I think a lot of the compute and the inference is going to ultimately be run on top of Trainium2. And I think that
that price performance are going to matter to people as they get to scale.
Then I would say that that middle layer of the stack are really – it's a combination of services that customers care
about to be able to build models and then to be able to leverage existing leading frontier models and then build
high-quality generative AI applications that do inference at scale.
And we see it for people building models, they continue to use SageMaker AI very expansively, and then
Bedrock, when you're leveraging leading frontier models is also growing very substantially.
And as I said in my opening comments, the number of agents of scale is still really small in the scheme of what's
going to be the case, but part of the problem is it's actually hard to actually build agents. And it's hard to deploy
these agents in a secure and scalable way.
And so I think the launches we made recently in strands that make it much easier to build agents and then agent
core that make it much easier to deploy at scale and in a secure way are being very well received and customers
are excited it's going to change what's possible on the agent side.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2025
And then I think that it's – you've got a very large number. I mean, remember, 85% to 90% of the global IT spend
is still on premises. If you believe that equation is going to flip, which I do, and we do, you have a lot of legacy
infrastructure that you've got to move. These are mainframes. These are VMware's instances and when we build
agents like AWS Transform, they make it much easier to move mainframes to the cloud, much easier to move
VMware to the cloud, much easier to move .NET, Windows to .NET Linux, [indiscernible] (00:48:02) those are
compelling for enterprises or things like Kiro that allow customers to develop in a much easier way and in a much
more structured way, which is why I think people are excited about it.
So I think I really like the inputs and the set of services that we're building in the AI space today. Customers really
like them and it's resonating with them. I still think it's very early days in AI and in terms of adoption.
But the other thing I would just say is that. Remember, because we're at a stage right now where so much of the
activity is training and figuring out how to get your generative AI applications into production. People aren't paying
as close attention as they will and making sure that those generative AI applications are operating where the rest
of their data and infrastructure is.
Remember, a lot of generative AI, inference is just going to be another building block like compute, storage and
database. And so people are going to actually want to run those applications close to where the other applications
are running, where their data is. There's just so many more applications and data running in AWS than anywhere
else. And I'm very optimistic about as we get to a bigger scale what's going to happen for AWS on the AI side.
And I think we have a set of services that is unique top to bottom in the stack.
I think on the last part about what do we expect with respect to acceleration, we don't give guidance by segment.
So I'm not going to try and give you guidance. But I do believe that the combination of more enterprises who have
resumed their march to modernize their infrastructure and move from on-premises to the cloud, coupled with the
fact that AI is going to accelerate in terms of more companies deploying more AI applications into production that
start to scale, coupled with the fact that I do think that more capacity is going to come online in the coming months
and quarters, make me optimistic about the AWS business.

Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Please proceed with
your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Josey Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks for that, Andy. That was really helpful. Maybe taking that same question, but focusing internally on
Amazon. I think you penned an article or a blog post back in June, just talking about the ability or potential with
Gen AI agents and improving efficiencies and speed to market internally.
So would love to hear your thoughts as you think about how Amazon is adopting generative AI internally, how
perhaps you've seen improving speed to market as a result of everything you've just talked about? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew R. Jassy A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Amazon.com, Inc.
Yeah. I think that AI is the biggest technology transformation in our lifetime, which is saying a lot because even in
some of our relatively short lifetimes, we've been through the cloud, mobile and the Internet itself. But I think it's
going to be the biggest transformation technically in our lifetime.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2025
And I think it's going to not only change every customer experience that we know and enable customer
experience we really only dreamed about before, but it's also going to change very substantially the way we work.
And if you think about it, the way that we do coding, the way that we do analytics, the way that we do research,
the way that we do finance and measure – I mean, really, the way we do business process automation, the way
we do customer service.
Every single area that I can think of in the way we work is likely going to be impacted in some meaningful way by
AI. And I think when you have a big shift like that, you have two macro choices.
You can either decide that you're going to embrace it. And you're going to help shape it and you're going to figure
out how to build the right tools to allow you to take advantage of the technology or you can wish it away and have
it shape you.
And the posting that you're referencing, Ron that I made was just really being clear with the team that we're going
to pursue that former approach. We are going to embrace it. We're going to try and shape it.
And so we have a number of tools and agents that we've built already inside the company. These are things like if
you think about Kiro and the opportunity to have coding agents do a lot of the coding that's very compelling. It's
going to allow our teammates to be able to start from a more advanced starting spot and to be able to invent for
customers much more quickly and much more expansively. If you think about services like Connect, which is our
AWS service, it does call center software that has a lot of AI built into it that changes the productivity of all your
customer service agents.
And you can just imagine across the board, the types of things we're going to do to make it easier to get software
out, to build high-quality software, to do operations, QA, to automate a lot of the business process coordination
that happens inside the kind. We're going to work on a whole bunch of those areas to allow ourselves primarily to
be able to invent for customers much more quickly and expansively.
But also, I think it's going to make all of our teammates' jobs much more enjoyable because they won't have to do
as many of the rote parts of the job that we all do right now, they're going to be able to own more pieces of what
they're trying to solve for customers. And we want deep owners that want to own as much end-to-end as possible.

Justin Post Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks. I'll just ask on the revenue guidance. It looks pretty robust growth in the third quarter. I know you
won't say whether AWS is expected to accelerate. But could you talk about some of the drivers and what kind of
tariff and other contingencies you've put in there? And then maybe any thoughts on how you're thinking about
how Q4 is shaping up? Thank you.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 31-Jul-2025
Yeah. Hi Justin, this is Brian. I'll take this one. We've guided to $174 billion to $175 billion. And we – excuse me,
$179.5 billion, typo. We feel good about the growth rate in Q2 that we had and the acceleration in a number of
areas, including units. And we had a very successful Prime Day earlier this month.
So there is uncertainty on where tariffs will settle and maybe the ultimate impact on consumers, as Andy
mentioned earlier. But we feel really good about the key inputs, we control price selection and convenience.
We've talked about delivery speeds increasing. We've talked about selection increasing, high-end stock levels,
well dispersed inventory close to customers. So we think that all works in our favor. So I would say we're
cautiously optimistic. I'm not going to give any guidance for Q4 at this time, but we'll talk about that next time.

Good afternoon and welcome to Teradata's 2025 second quarter earnings call. Steve MacMillan, Teradata's
President and Chief Executive Officer, will lead our call today. Followed by John Ederer, Teradata's Chief
Financial Officer, who'll discuss our financial results and outlook.
Our discussion today includes forecasts and other information that are considered forward-looking statements.
While these statements reflect our current outlook, they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that
could cause actual results to differ materially. These risk factors are described in today's earnings release and in
our SEC filings, including our most recent form 10-K and in the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025,
that is expected to be filed with the SEC within the next few days. These forward-looking statements are made as
of today and we undertake no duty or obligation to update them.
On today's call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures which exclude such items as stock
based compensation expense and other special items described in our earnings release. We will also discuss
other non-GAAP items such as free cash flow, constant currency comparisons, and 2025 revenue and ARR
growth outlook in constant currency. Unless stated otherwise, all numbers and results discussed on today's call
are on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in our earnings release,
which is accessible on the Investor Relations page of our website at investor.teradata.com. A replay of this
conference call will be available later today on our website.
And now, I will turn the call over to Steve.

Thanks, Chad, and hello, everyone. Teradata delivered well in Q2 as we continued to see improved execution
across the company. We delivered total ARR of $1.49 billion in Q2, up 2% year-over-year as reported. This gives
us additional confidence in our ability to achieve our full year targets. We are seeing improvements in linearity in
both expansions and renewals resulting from the go to market actions that started in the middle of 2024 to
improve our sales execution. We experienced better deal execution in Q2 with some deals closing in the quarter
that had been expected in Q3. We see customers recognizing the importance of and the value of strong data
management capabilities to underpin their AI and GenAI initiatives.
We meaningfully improved overall retention rates again in Q2 and we expect this to continue for the full year
2025. Thanks to the team's positive efforts in managing ongoing contracts with customers, we were able to

extend some contracts into the back half of the year. From a cloud perspective, we delivered ARR of $634 million
as we see continued migrations and expansions. The solid 15% constant currency cloud ARR growth is in line
with our full year guidance range of 14% to 18%.
I'll start the quarterly update with the new executive leadership members we recently brought on. During our last
earnings update, we introduced Sumeet Arora, our new Chief Product Officer, and I'm pleased to have John
Ederer, our new CFO, on the call today. In the quarter we also announced Scot Rogers as our new Chief
Administrative Officer as we streamlined our people and law functions. These veteran executives are here to help
our ongoing strategic execution as we position the company to accelerate growth and deliver ongoing, durable,
free cash flow. They have proven track records and have acted with urgency to make important marks on the
business in a short period of time as we work to return to growth and drive long term returns for our investors.
Additionally, we realigned our marketing function into our TTM and product organizations. Integrating these
functions is designed to gain operational efficiency and increase agility and speed in execution as we unify our
approach to developing our pipeline and serving our customers. This restructuring supports our growth objectives
while removing costs to optimize our operating margin.
I'm confident that we've got the right leadership team to address the market's changing priorities and to take
advantage of AI as the value driver. The pervasive interest in AI and GenAI is leading to growth across the
industry and increasingly in a hybrid environment. We see companies incorporating the deployment option that
works best for each need, whether cloud, on-prem, or a hybrid approach. We are building on our cloud growth
and leveraging our strength in on-prem to provide customers with the hybrid data and analytics environments they
need. We believe that customers' investments in high quality, trusted data will pay dividends in high quality,
trusted AI outcomes.
Our differentiated capabilities are designed to deliver consistent, world-class data and analytics across an open
and connected ecosystem. We help customers incorporate what is the right for their business regardless of the
deployment option they choose. Agentic AI is the now industry topic, and we introduced a number of innovation
advancements that we believe are keeping us ahead of the curve. With our recent Teradata AI Factory
announcement, we are bringing AI and machine learning capabilities on-prem. Integrated within NVIDIA's AI
Enterprise, companies and regulated industries, are those that have data sovereignty requirements or want more
control over their AI deployments, can now have private AI with the security, governance, and cost control of on-
prem.
Enterprise Vector Store that we announced last quarter is now generally available and is being cost effectively
combined structured and unstructured data with the speed needed to get value out of complex business
challenges. This is a crucial infrastructure component for building trusted and efficient AI systems. And is
designed to help customers go beyond basic GenAI implementations towards sophisticated Agentic AI use cases
like Customer Complaint Analyzer and Augmented Call Center.
We also recently announced our open-source MCP, Model Context Protocol server. MCP is the industry standard
technology that enables AI agents to interact with backend data platforms to get the context needed to make
smart decisions and developing Agentic AI initiatives, the challenge is not just about building smarter models, it's
about getting those models access to the right context.
With this technology, we expect to enable our customers' AI agents to connect to the Teradata systems and
leverage ClearScape Analytics to both report on and build predictions around business processes and operations,
ultimately, significantly increasing the usage of the Vantage platform. This is designed to be enabled through

trusted enterprise data cost effectively and at any scale. This combination can empower organizations to move
beyond isolated AI experiments and deploy intelligent, context aware agents that drive real business outcomes
and value.
We also introduced LLMOps, enabling enterprises to accelerate how they deploy, manage and monitor language
models. LLMOps is a capability in Teradata ModelOps 8.1. It is designed to support rapid deployment of NVIDIA
inference microservices and enable users to select from over 80 models and deploy them directly into GPU
environments. We believe that this technology supports rapid deployment of GenAI applications, including right
pipelines and is designed to accelerate time to market for AI/ML initiatives.
We have expanded support for Teradata OTFs with access to Iceberg and Delta Lake tables across AWS, Azure
and Google Cloud. This enables VantageCloud enterprise customers to begin OTF testing and application
development as they build future-ready enterprises. Of course, we deliver these innovations in support of one
goal, helping our customers achieve massive value from the data and analytics, which in turn helps us continue to
grow. I'll walk through a few examples.
We're helping one of the largest banks in the world and a longstanding customer to build an anti-money
laundering analytics capability for its financial crimes division. Here, our customer-focused innovation base helped
co-develop this analytics platform to the customers' needs. This is an example of how we are leveraging AI and
ClearScape Analytics to enhance sales to our base.
A multinational bank in APJ is using GenAI with Teradata to improve its customer experience. In this AI for CX
use, we are processing 50,000 interactive text conversations a week on complex data. That helps rapidly identify
friction points with customers to improve customer satisfaction and unlock significant value for the bank.
We're helping a large European logistics company deliver on a strategic initiative to drive digital transformation
across its broad set of operations by integrating relevant data to accelerate and innovate its business.
A US financial services company established a new on-prem Vantage ecosystem in their new private cloud data
center to modernize current platforms, with growth from increased workloads driven by operationalizing AI with
Teradata ClearScape Analytics.
And finally, a Middle Eastern financial institution added Teradata, replacing a longstanding competitor, to improve
its customers' experience.
We're also gearing up for our annual customer event, Possible, the Trusted AI and Data Conference. We'll have a
robust suite of speakers from many fantastic customers, as well as leading partner companies and industry
experts. We will be hosting this event in LA on October 6th through the October 8th. There are many more details
on our website.
We remain focused on accelerating innovation and value for our customers across an open and connected
ecosystem as they implement AI initiatives. We do this with a global network of industry-leading partners, and Q2
was a great quarter of partner collaborations. In May, we announced a new data integration with ServiceNow's
Workflow Data Fabric. This integration is designed to connect, understand and activate customer data on the
ServiceNow AI platform to fuel AI agents, autonomous workflows and analytics at scale.
Teradata also participated in the Salesforce announcement, expanding its AI agent ecosystem, AgentExchange.
Agents built in Agentforce can easily discover and connect to our MCP server through AgentExchange. This is

designed to provide the enterprise context that powers trusted decisioning. For instance, an agent can request the
next batch recommendation based on customer history, sentiment and/or behavior in order to deliver a relevant
offer to our customers in real time.
In Q2, we also announced a new partnership with Fivetran to transform data pipelines for rapid AI insights.
Together, we expect to simplify data integration for our customers by automating data movement from hundreds
of sources across the enterprise into Teradata. With this integration, Teradata and Fivetran can empower
customers to leverage all of their data for complex AI workloads and drive trusted AI at scale, reducing
engineering overhead so teams can focus on insights, not pipelines.
We will continue to invest in innovations and partnerships that make it easy for our customers to build and
achieve value from their Agentic AI solutions with Teradata.
As I turn the call to John, I'll summarize Q2 as a quarter of progress on many fronts. As we have restructured the
company and executed, we've built a solid foundation for longer term, durable free cash flow growth for the
company. Our deep data and analytics capabilities position us well to address the secular drivers in technology
resulting from AI.
After solid execution in the first half of the year, we have increased confidence and we are reiterating our outlook
for ARR and free cash flow metrics for the year. As we look ahead, we see the opportunity for greater operating
leverage and free cash flow growth from our ongoing work to optimize our expense envelope.
And now, I'll pass the call to John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Ederer
Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In the second quarter, we finished above the high end of our
recurring revenue outlook range, at the top end of our total revenue range, and earnings per share outperformed
our expectations.
Total ARR grew 2% year-over-year on a reported basis and was flat from a constant currency perspective. Our
cloud ARR growth rate was 17% reported and 15% in constant currency. And our cloud net expansion rate was
112%, performing in line with expectations. We continue to see a balanced mix of migrations and expansions
driving our cloud ARR.
While acknowledging the boost from currency this quarter, we did achieve total ARR growth sooner than
anticipated this year, as we're able to pull in a few deals early and extend other customers from a retention
perspective. The timing of these deals will have some impact on our Q3 ARR metrics, but we continue to believe
that we are on track to achieve total ARR growth in Q4 on a constant currency basis. And we are reiterating our
FY 2025 outlook for total ARR, cloud ARR, and free cash flow.
In terms of our detailed financial results for the second quarter, total revenue was $408 million, down 6% year-
over-year as reported, and 7% in constant currency, which was at the high end of our outlook. Recurring revenue
was $354 million, down 4% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency, which was 1-point above the
high end of our outlook. Upfront recurring revenue had a negligible impact on the growth rate.
Recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 87%, up from 84% in Q2 last year. Services revenue

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 05-Aug-2025
business has been a headwind this year for total revenue growth, we expected a higher mix of recurring revenue
will ultimately provide a stronger business model with better margins.
Looking at profitability and free cash flow. Please note that I will be referencing non-GAAP numbers for expenses
and margins and a full reconciliation to GAAP results is provided in our press release. For the second quarter,
total gross margin was 58.3%, which was down year-over-year, primarily due to the headwinds in our services
business. In line with our ongoing focus to proactively manage productivity, we've taken cost actions in Q2 to
enable us to return to positive service gross margin in the second half of 2025. And we will continue to optimize
costs as we manage the business.
Recurring gross margin was also impacted by year-over-year revenue, primarily due to headwinds stemming from
our ARR performance last year and increasing cloud mix. Operating margin for Q2 was 16.4%, which was
impacted by lower revenue and gross margins. Looking specifically at operating expenses, the actions that we
took last year resulted in lower SG&A expense in dollar terms, that was partially offset by investments in R&D.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.47, exceeding the top end of our outlook range. The
outperformance is primarily from higher revenue. We generated $39 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which
is flat on a year-over-year basis. And finally, in the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $28 million of
our stock or 1.3 million shares. And we continue to expect to return at least 50% of our free cash flow to
shareholders in the form of share repurchases.
Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. For the third quarter of 2025, we expect recurring revenue to
be in the range of minus 4% to minus 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. We expect total revenue
to be in the range of minus 7% to minus 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. And we expect non-
GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.55.
While we do not typically provide quarterly guidance on total ARR and cloud ARR, I did want to point out a shift in
linearity that we are seeing in the business. As noted, we were able to pull in some deals into Q2 and extend
some other customers which resulted in Q2 total ARR and cloud ARR coming in above our expectations.
However, due to this shift, we anticipate that Q3 cloud ARR will dip below our target range for the year, but we're
still reaffirming our full year target.
For total ARR, we anticipate a modest sequential decline in dollars from Q2 to Q3. For FY 2025, we reaffirm our
guidance for cloud ARR, total ARR, recurring revenue and cash flow and these ranges can be found in our Q2
press release.
We are tightening the ranges for the full year on the following metrics. For total revenue, we are updating the
range to minus 5% to minus 7% year-over-year in constant currency due to lower services, bookings and
anticipated revenue. For earnings per share, our updated outlook for GAAP EPS is $1.04 to $1.12, and for non-
GAAP EPS is $2.17 to $2.25.
Based on FX rates at the end of July, our reported total ARR and cloud ARR growth rates should be
approximately 100 to 200 basis points above our constant currency growth rates in Q4 2025. For revenue, we do
not anticipate any currency impact to our full year outlook.
Finally, we expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 23.1% and the weighted average shares
outstanding to be 96.5 million for the full year. Again, please refer to our Q2 earnings presentation on our Investor
Relations website for a complete list of our 2025 outlook ranges.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 05-Aug-2025
In closing, I'm very excited to join the company at a time when our Hybrid Trusted AI platform is becoming
increasingly important in the market. I look forward to working with Steve and the rest of the team as we continue
to transform Teradata and drive a profitable growth strategy. I believe we are taking the necessary steps to set
ourselves up for improved profitability and durable free cash flow growth, which should in turn drive shareholder
value.
Thank you all for your time today. Now let's open the call up for questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] . In the interest of giving everyone the opportunity, we appreciate that you limit
yourself to one question and one follow-up. The first question we have on the line comes from Erik Woodring with
Morgan Stanley. Erik, your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik W. Woodring Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks so much for taking my question, guys. And John, welcome aboard officially now. So, Steve, I
wanted to circle back with you. You made a comment right before you passed it to John that I thought was
interesting. And you said, we see an opportunity for greater operating leverage and free cash flow looking
forward, as you optimize your OpEx envelope. Can you maybe just unpackage that comment a bit for us? Just
kind of help us understand what you mean either from a size, a texture or even a timing perspective? And then I
have a follow-up, please. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Erik. And maybe John could add a little bit of color commentary as well. So
clearly, as we're going through the year, we've optimized our cost and expense envelope and we're going to
continue doing that as we go through the rest of the year. The key driver for it, though, and something that we're
pretty confident and given our execution in first half, is clearly returning the company to growth. And the execution
that we've had in the first half of the year has given us some surety in terms of our outlook to returning to total
ARR growth in FY 2025.
And so from an operating perspective, I think we've built the foundations for durable free cash flow growth, and
that is then being compounded by our ARR, our outlook to grow our ARR and the full year. And as those reflect –
both reflect into our outlook for FY 2026, we see that durable free cash flow growth is a real opportunity for us to
drive forward into the future. John, I don't know if you want to add anything.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Ederer A
Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
I think that's very well said. I wouldn't add much in terms of specific numbers for FY 2026, but I would say that I
think we are laying the foundation this year. We're taking the actions that we need to. We talked about some of
the things specifically in the second quarter, but we're really setting ourselves up to have a strong finish to this
year and then look out to next year as well.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 05-Aug-2025
Erik W. Woodring Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay, thanks. And then maybe I should have asked these questions in reverse order because, Steve, I wanted to
again ask kind of what you alluded to, which is from a kind of top line and demand perspective and client
engagement perspective, what's next? Right. You highlight solid execution in the first half of the year. Obviously,
a couple moving pieces between 2Q and 3Q, but solid execution is what you need to do today. But what's next?
How are you playing kind of offense from here? Help us understand – help us kind of dream the dream, so to
speak, of where this model in this story can go as you think about the changes you've made over the last 12
months and the dividends that they could pay out over the next 12 months, so to speak? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah, thanks, Erik. And I think the changes that we put in place in terms of go-to-market execution in midyear last
year have made a good delta in terms of our overall execution and sales execution in the market. But
underpinning that really is the underlying demand for the Teradata technology stack and especially in our ability to
execute in a hybrid environment. That open and connected ecosystem that can expand across both on-prem
environments and cloud environments is something I think that's resonating very well in the marketplace and very
well with our customers.
And I think the age of AI and Agentic AI is really powering that as well. So I think that is setting us up to address a
new target addressable marketplace from an AI workload perspective. And our most recent announcements with
AI Factory, which is an on-prem solution to deliver AI solutions for our customers and their most trusted
environment behind the firewall, as well as having those capabilities extend out into the cloud, gives us some real
opportunity to drive growth and workload usage on the Teradata platform, both in the cloud and on-prem.
And those two factors together will enable us to drive forward. And in addition, we've done a really good job over
the last four to five years growing our cloud business to over $630 million now still, but really good growth rates
from a cloud perspective. We reported 15 points year-on-year growth in Q2. So, really a solid growth there. And
we do see the AI workloads from an on-prem perspective helping stabilize and actually get some growth in the
on-prem marketplace. So these together actually set us up for good subsequent future growth.

Erik W. Woodring Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks so much, Steve. Good luck.

Operator: Your next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi. Your line is open, Tyler.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tyler Radke Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Yeah, thank you for taking the question. Steve, maybe first one for you. Encouraging to hear some
outperformance on ARR in the quarter. It sounds like a lot of it was timing related pulling in some deals from Q3.
But I was just curious was there – was this sort of driven by the customer? Was this more just better execution in
terms of managing the sales pipeline?
And did you see these deals like come in stronger than you expected as well just in terms of the expansion
potential? I assume there was – these were cloud deals because the cloud sequential growth was pretty strong.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 05-Aug-2025
But just anything you could expand upon in terms of the deals that came in? And then, if you're expecting like any
type of headwind in terms of sequential growth into Q3? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Tyler. Yeah, we're really happy with the team's performance in Q2. Deal execution was clearly
ahead of the pace. And obviously whenever the field team can, they will close the deal as early as they can. The
team's been doing a lot of work on linearity and making sure that we improve linearity and therefore our execution
in the first half and in Q2 in particular has given us a lot of confidence in terms of execution for the full year and
getting back to total ARR growth for the full year.
The dynamics that we see is actually our customers want to take advantage of the Teradata platform and they
want to do that both on-prem and in the cloud. And we saw good growth in the quarter both – in both of those
facets, both behind the firewall and also in the cloud. The hybrid capabilities of our platform and how we're
positioning that platform in our customers' environments in terms of, being the trusted custodians of some of the
customers' most valuable data, making that available to AI solutions, then say the customer environment I think is
really driving some interest and workload for us.
And it's giving the sales teams an opportunity to take a really powerful value proposition to our customers,
especially when we combine that with the offers and capabilities that we've got. Again, what I would say is, as we
execute through and look at the second half of the year, it has given us some faith in terms of returning the
company to that total ARR growth in FY 2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tyler Radke Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay, great. And then, on the margin side, I mean, it sounds like there were some optimizations in the quarter. I
know you talked about kind of the move away from margin services revenues and then some consolidation within
the go-to-market function. But it didn't look like you really raised profitability guidance too much. So just curious, is
there kind of more conservatism in that? Are you sort of redeploying some of those savings into R&D? And just
kind of help us understand, as you assess the cost base here, like what the timing for kind of additional steps and
unlocks could be? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Ederer A
Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Yeah, sure. This is John. I'll take a stab at that one. So I would start by saying I think we're doing a good job
overall on managing expenses, up and down the P&L. If you look at some of the revenue headwinds that we have
this year that are implied from our guidance to be able to be tracking towards an operating margin percentage
that's on par with last year is no small feat. And so, I think the team has done a great job of managing this along
the way.
In terms of some of the specific operating expenses, on the SG&A side, Steve mentioned some of the actions that
we took last year, that actually resulted in a year-over-year decline in terms of dollars spent on SG&A. We did
reinvest some of that back on the R&D side of things. And so, we're going to continue to invest in innovation that
will support our profitable growth strategy. But overall, I think we're doing a good job of managing expenses and,
like we said earlier, laying the foundation for durable free cash flow growth.

Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thank you.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Radi Sultan with UBS. You may proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Radi Sultan Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Awesome. Thank you. Maybe first for Steve. As you think about the second half of the year, just curious what do
you see as the biggest catalyst behind migrations to Vantage? And then, is there any way to think about what
portion of those migrations are related to a GenAI use case?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. Thanks for that question. I think I would – could point to two market shifts of note in terms of our customer
conversations that we're having. The first one is, we're starting to try for significant pipeline of AI influence growth
for the Teradata platform, and that we're seeing these workloads being deployed both on-prem and in the cloud.
And that's really playing to our strength of having a hybrid platform, having a platform that can run these
workloads on-prem and give customers real capabilities around AI with trusted data and great data management
on-prem. And then, a lot of our customers that migrate and deploy in the cloud with us retain a hybrid model. And
that's something that really differentiates us from an execution perspective.
And then, I think the second shift in terms of cloud migrations is we are seeing a reduction in the number of what I
would call pure play cloud migrations, where the customer is looking to migrate to the cloud to generate some
form of cost optimization. I think a lot of customers are realizing the value of the cloud comes from the flexibility
and agility and the services that are available in the cloud rather than a cost play. And so, I think some customers
are being more sensitive to where they are migrating their data to make sure that they get the best value out of
that.
We've talked in the past about some stage migrations. That is really manifested now in use of Teradata's hybrid
capabilities. There is a bank in Australia which has deployed across the cloud and on-prem utilizing QueryGrid to
link all of its data together across a fairly complex environment. And I think we are seeing our customers start to
take advantage of those hybrid capabilities that only Teradata can bring to the marketplace.
So I think these together – those market shifts together are helping us deliver that cloud growth of 15% in Q2, and
also pointing us in the right direction for total ARR growth for this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Radi Sultan Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Awesome. Super clear. And then, a follow-up for John. Given this is your first quarter as CFO, just curious, like
what did you see in your first few months at Teradata that gave you confidence in underwriting the current
guidance framework, especially those linearity comments around Q3 and Q4?

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 05-Aug-2025
Yeah. I mean, I think there's almost two different questions in there. So just in terms of the guidance overall, I
think we looked at several things. But if I kind of step back and take a look at where we are at the midpoint of the
year, I feel like we're in good shape. We've actually executed well against the plan and did a little bit better than
anticipated on the ARR metrics in Q2. So that certainly helps.
I think the second factor is the work we've been doing on erosions. Last year was a difficult year from an erosion
perspective. We've actually had quite a bit of improvement this year. And so, when you think about that from a
modeling standpoint, that really helps in terms of the overall visibility. So I think as we sit here at the midway
point, we feel good about the execution we've had over the first half, and that gives us a better sense for how well
we can do over the course of the year.
The last couple of things I would point to is just the new products are really starting generate some interest,
especially AI. And so, Steve just talked through all of those. But we're starting to see those come into the
opportunities that the sales team is working on. And so, I think all of those factors come together to help support
the second half outlook. Obviously, we need to still go out and execute, but the opportunity is there.

Operator: Your next question comes from Chirag Ved with Evercore ISI. Your line is open, Chirag.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chirag Ved Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Steve, what are you noticing about how companies are thinking about on-prem
versus cloud deployments in this AI world, especially when it comes to modernizing their data estates? And how
this might be similar or different from what you might have seen or heard over the past year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Chirag. I think this – the world of Agentic AI is really powered by access to data across
environments. And I think we're seeing a lot of our customers, especially the very large customers and across the
world, thinking about how their data is deployed and then working out what the modern access and management
capabilities that they want to put in place to actually execute AI workloads against those data.
So the great thing about the Teradata platform is that we can preserve data gravity. We give customers the
choice at deploying either on-prem or in the cloud and get the same capabilities and the same great function and
features and functions both behind the firewall and in the cloud and operating in that hybrid environment.
And I think we're tending to see an increase in the interest in terms of our on-prem platform. I think we're seeing
some new logo activities where we're selling net new systems on-prem, especially in regions and markets where
data sovereignty is incredibly important. And so having a capability that enables customers to take advantage of
the most recent AI models, be it large language models, operating on-prem, and executing that with a trusted data

management and governance capability which Teradata supplies, is really driving some customers decisions
about where they place their data and how they get access to those AI applications.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chirag Ved Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Thanks, Steve. And maybe one quick one for John. It looks like cloud net retention rates dropped sequentially. Do
you see cloud growth in fiscal year 2025 being more driven by new cloud customers and net new migration or by
stabilization and/or expansion in the metric? Thanks so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Ederer A
Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Sure. No, thanks for the question. I would say it's probably more the latter. And so we've continued to see pretty
consistent results in terms of the drivers of growth. And so we've got roughly 50% of our cloud ARR growth
coming from migrations and about 50% coming from expansions. Now that can vary a little bit by quarter. But in
general, that's the trend line that we see and that's what we would expect to see for the rest of this year.

Matthew Hedberg Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve, you started the prepared remarks talking about Agentic AI and how
you're thinking a lot about it from a Teradata perspective. I'm curious, how would you expect to monitor usage or
success from a customer basis there? Because it seems obviously it's a topical conversation among customers.
And how would you define success there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. I think we're defining success on a couple of dimensions. One, I'll talk about partner. From a partner
perspective, we're engaging with a number of partners that are very successful and critical in terms of executing
this AI world. And so the two examples I gave were ServiceNow and Salesforce. We're super excited about the
partnership that we have with ServiceNow. And ServiceNow are excited about the partnership with Teradata
because they see the opportunity to utilize, analyze, and for Teradata to develop the signals out of their customer
data is an example that we have in the Teradata platform, and then to trigger workflows in the ServiceNow
platform or trigger workflows in the Salesforce platform to actually get some form of execution.
So, I think, one of the dimensions is the work that we're doing with partners in terms of leading-edge use cases
and the development of leading-edge use cases. The second is the proof-of-concept that we're doing with
customers. So, early customer engagement in terms of the advanced technologies that we've got. So, some of

the work that we're doing in terms of customer complaint analyzer, taking some of our vector capabilities and
utilizing vector capabilities as well as running language models both inside the Teradata environment, but also
sitting next to the Teradata environment.
And I gave some examples in the prepared remarks of a bank in Australia that is doing just that in terms of
combining structured SQL based insights from a data perspective with some language model capabilities to look
at how they impact their overall customer satisfaction is a great use case.
And then the third dimension is really looking at our opportunity pipeline. We started measuring and managing the
opportunity pipeline in terms of opportunities that are being influenced by AI workloads inside our customers. And
that's really driving utilization for the Teradata platform and for the customers.
So, as we look at holistic execution in this AI and Agentic AI marketplace, we're really rapidly advancing some of
the capabilities that we need. For example, we recently announced our new MCP server that will enable us to
work in the Agentic space. And that was as a direct result of some of the work that we're doing with our customers
and the deployments that we're getting engaged in. So super excited about really an incremental target
addressable marketplace for us from an AI perspective.

Matthew Hedberg Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Thanks for that. And then John, for you, curious if you – what's sort of the thought process on the recent
R&D tax changes? Do you think that might have an impact to you guys next year? And any way to kind of think
about the potential benefit of that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Ederer A
Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. I do think there could be some impact from that. And it'll probably show up on the cash flow side of things.
It's a little too early for me to give you specifics on that, but it's definitely something that we're taking a close look
at, and it's something that could impact – positively impact cash flow this year as well as next year.

Wamsi Mohan Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thank you so much. A few on the Teradata AI Factory. How do you see the revenue there evolving and how
much revenue uplift could you see from this over time? Curious if you could share maybe any color on the
pipeline, the type of customers? Because investors have generally been waiting for some traction in enterprise AI
adoption. So, given your comments about that fitting in on-prem, how do you think that evolves? And I have a
follow-up.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 05-Aug-2025
Yeah. Just as – thanks for the question, Wamsi. Just to educate all, AI Factory is our capability that brings the
power of AI to enterprises that are looking to deploy and scale artificial intelligence solutions with trust control and
speed into hybrid environments. So that's both on-prem and in the cloud. And there's a lot of benefits that that
gives to our customers in terms of enabling them to actually really deploy real production-oriented workloads and
solutions from an AI perspective.
Clearly, it's early days in terms of our release of the AI Factory, but we are very excited, especially when we look
at our partnership with organizations like NVIDIA, where we can take an NVIDIA GPU farm and essentially place
a dedicated Teradata instance, run in our capabilities from the AI Factory perspective, leveraging that GPU
instance to run real AI workload on-prem with trusted data for our customers.
So early days from a revenue perspective and ARR perspective, certainly seen a lot of interest in that in the
marketplace. And we're excited about how that's going to drive in the short-term usage of the Teradata platform.
But then longer term dedicated Teradata instances both in the cloud and on-prem, to deliver these workloads.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Wamsi Mohan Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Steve. And maybe one for John. Sorry, if I missed this, but can you talk about the magnitude of
what you think were deals that got pulled forward from Q3 to Q2? Clearly, obviously, you highlighted some in – on
the public cloud side, but in overall terms, how would you quantify that magnitude? And would – should we expect
to see some of that behavior persist given some of the more broader macro uncertainty around tariffs and other
things like that? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Ederer A
Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Yeah, sure. We did not quantify the magnitude. And I won't give you a specific number here, but I will describe
kind of the shape of what we're talking about. And I think, this was an earlier question, my apologies. I neglected
to come back to it. So, in terms of cloud ARR, we actually made great progress in Q2 and we are a little ahead of
schedule as we were able to pull in a few of these deals early and extend some other customers.
And I think, the company had previously commented that we expected the first half of the year to be towards the
bottom end of our annual guidance range for cloud ARR growth. And so we came in a little bit better than
anticipated in Q2. But with some of that timing, we've effectively changed the slope of the curve for cloud ARR
this year. And so, at the beginning of the year where we were expecting a more linear path from Q2 to Q3 to Q4,
we've now had a bigger step up in Q2, we'll be a little flatter in Q3 and then we'll step up again in Q4.
And so, I think that's probably the best that I can quantify for you here. We don't typically provide quarterly
guidance on these metrics, but we did want to give you all the heads up in terms of this change in dynamic.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 05-Aug-2025
Operator: Your next question comes from Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Jungjohann Q
Analyst, TD Cowen
Hi, Tim. This is Jared Jungjohann on for Derrick Wood. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I'm understanding
that eight figure deals have been excluded in guidance. Can you talk to what you've been seeing with these larger
engagements?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah, thanks for the question, Jared. I think, I – we characterize it by really de-risking our outlook from an eight-
figure deal perspective. The good news is that from an sales execution, our go-to-market team has a number of
paths to get to our outlook for the year, both from a cloud perspective and a total ARR perspective.
Our absolute focus, though, is to drive growth in total ARR because that's really going to give us the profitable
revenue growth into next year in terms of growing a recurring revenue stream. The profitability of a recurring
revenue streams is certainly the most profitable segment that we have, and that will obviously lay the groundwork
for some durable free cash flow growth as we move forward.
The execution that we've seen in the first half of the year in terms of both retention perspective and getting
meaningful improvement in retention against that outlier from a retention perspective in 2024 has set us in good
stead in terms of that execution. And then, in terms of just taking advantage of the market opportunity that's in
front of us, the hybrid opportunities, I've seen that on-prem has some real strength in terms of being able to
deliver meaningful growth.
And then, just the fact that we've now got that big cloud business with over $630 million. And as we grow that at
mid-double digit, mid-teens in terms of growth for this year, that has some meaningful growth impact to our
numbers as well.
So a number of different paths to execute in terms of both eight-figure deals and some smaller deals as well. So
we're pretty confident about the execution as we move into second half, and the sales team is doing a great job.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Jungjohann Q
Analyst, TD Cowen
Okay. I appreciate that color. And then, one more for me on, I believe you guys started to introduce open table
formats in early 2024. So now that we're a little bit along with those efforts, can you just talk to, for the customers
that have adopted these, how have those companies' ACVs been trending? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. Our OTF strategy has always been to support both Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake without walking any of
our customers into one structure or another. And so, given that real choice of deployment. I've always stated that I
believe that open table format would actually be a tailwind for us in terms of the more data that you make
available to the Teradata platform and the Teradata engines, the more usage of the platform that we'll get. And
therefore, that incremental use is driving bigger Teradata systems and execution.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 05-Aug-2025
And certainly, as we've continued to increase our analytics capability and portfolio, I talked about the ability to
bring your own language models into the Teradata environment and combining that and opening up as much data
as possible inside a customer environment really does give it a tailwind from an execution perspective. So I think
as our customers are looking at open table format and the open table formats that they've got inside their
environment, they're working out how to use the Teradata platform to execute that analytics strategy and all of the
analytics functions that we've got inside the Vantage platform against that data source.
And just as an example of doing that. We've got us a customer in Latin America who actually replaced the
Databricks analytics solution with using Vantage analytics to actually run highly performant analytic capabilities at
a fraction of the cost and incremental improvement in performance. So we see the opportunity to help customers
modernize their data and analytic environments, and open table format continues to be a tailwind for us.

Operator: Thank you. We now have Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sheldon McMeans Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi. This is Sheldon McMeans on for Raimo. Thanks for taking our question. First for Steve. Can you help further
contextualize the improvements in retention rates you discussed in your prepared remarks? And maybe how
should we think about the drivers of that between better sales execution with maybe some of the AI-related
solutions that you've come out with that shows your future proof roadmap? And then, just general improvement in
the macro environment because it does seem like we're past kind of the peak uncertainty on the tariff front.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah. I think just from a retention perspective and as we said all along, we did know that 2024 was going to be an
outlier from an erosion perspective, particularly in our on-prem business. And looking back, we actually started to
see those improvements in the second half of 2024. We saw that improvement continue in 2025. And as we've
said all along, as we looked at the guidance that we gave for our full year at the start of the year, we're going to
see that. And we expect to see that meaningful improvement to our retention rates for FY 2025 overall.
I think you're absolutely right from a tariff and a macro perspective. We've done an assessment as our cloud
business grows that is a little bit more immune from a tariff perspective. And then, from a macroeconomic
environment, I think there has been some scrutiny on discretionary spend. That's impacted our consulting billings
at the start of the year, as we've spoken to already. But I think we are starting to see a little bit more confidence
from a macroeconomic perspective, and we're expecting good execution to continue and try to deliver a good full
year 2025 result.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sheldon McMeans Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Understood. Thanks for that. And I believe in the prepared remarks, included commentary about a quarter-over-
quarter decline in ARR expected in Q3. I would love to hear what are some of the driving factors of that as I would
think that the pull-forward from Q3 into Q2 would be relatively neutral as that would still be in the Q3 balance
there.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 05-Aug-2025
Yeah. That was some of the comments that I made just a few minutes ago. But in general, we're expecting to see
a change in the slope, if you will, for this year. So where we had expected to see a more gradual climb up,
particularly in cloud ARR through the year, where we saw a bigger step up in Q2, a little flatter in Q3, and then we
expect to see a step-up again in Q4.
In terms of total ARR, we're actually tracking a little ahead of the plan. We are hoping to get back to positive
territory by the end of the year. We actually got to positive growth this quarter, now with a little bit of help from
currency. But even on a constant currency basis, got back to flat this quarter. And so, I think we're tracking pretty
well. We may see a slight decline in total ARR in Q3, but I feel like we're very much on track for the full year.

Sheldon McMeans Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Got it. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. We now have Patrick Walravens with Citizens Bank. Your line is open, Patrick.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nicholas Jones Q
Analyst, Citizens JMP Securities LLC
Hi, guys. Thank you for taking the question. This is Nick on for Pat. Steve, one for you to start? NVIDIA recently
published a research paper highlighting the efficiency of SLMs for handling more routine Agentic tasks. Is this
consistent with what you're seeing across your customer base? And are you noticing increased interest or
adoption of SLMs for enterprise Agentic AI workloads?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve McMillan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Teradata Corp.
Yeah, that's a great question. In fact, we are seeing customers deploy small language models like Hugging Face
to get specialized results. So, it could be in terms of looking at customer feedback or call center interactions. So
instead of putting that through a large language model using a really specialized small language model. The really
exciting thing for us is our massively parallel architectures that we deploy on-prem and in the cloud is really well-
suited to running these small language models.
So actually in some tests with one of the banks in the US, we actually ran the Hugging Face model on our parallel
CPU architecture and it actually ran better than running it on an NVIDIA GPU. So, this was clearly very exciting
for our customer in terms of utilizing a small language model in the Teradata environment, very effectively and
efficiently to get some really great business outcomes.
So, yeah, we absolutely see the small language models as being a good opportunity for us, and it really
emphasizes the words I used were open and connected. We don't want to be locked into any one particular
language model as some of our competitors have done. We want to be able to enable our customers to have a
full deployment choice and to use the language models in the right place, whether that's behind the firewall or in
the cloud. And they can choose which language model to use, both in terms of size, but also in terms of what
brand to use. Yeah. So that's the great thing about having that open and connected ecosystem.

Q2 2025 Earnings Call 05-Aug-2025
Fantastic. That's super interesting. And one follow up, John, for you. It's been around three months since you are
appointed as CFO. What is one thing that's gone better than you expected and one thing that's been more
challenging than you expected?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Ederer A
Chief Financial Officer, Teradata Corp.
Sure. The – well, I'll start on the positive side of things. And I think that you look at the Q2 results and we
obviously started off with a solid quarter. So that makes my job a little bit easier coming in. On the other side of
the coin, it's just a matter of getting to know a new business. And so, there's a lot to learn when you come into any
new company.
And I do think there are some complexities to what we do here at Teradata, both from a technology standpoint as
well as from a business model standpoint. So, getting up to speed on all of those elements is something that I've
been very focused on the last few months.
